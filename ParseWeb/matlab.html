<title>MATLAB Variables</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Variables</h1>

<p>In MATLAB environment, every variable is an array or matrix.</p>

<p>You can assign variables in a simple way. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>It creates a 1-by-1 matrix named <i>x</i> and stores the value 3 in its element. Let us check another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that &minus;</p>

<p>Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.</p>

<p>Variables must have values before they are used.</p>

<p>When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can use this variable <b>ans</b> &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let's look at another example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Assignments</h2>

<p>You can have multiple assignments on the same line. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>I have forgotten the Variables!</h2>

<p>The <b>who</b> command displays all the variable names you have used.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>whos</b> command displays little more about the variables &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>clear</b> command deletes all (or the specified) variable(s) from the memory.</p>

<h2>Long Assignments</h2>

<p>Long assignments can be extended to another line by using an ellipses (...). For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The format Command</h2>

<p>By default, MATLAB displays numbers with four decimal place values. This is known as <b>short format</b>.</p>

<p>However, if you want more precision, you need to use the <b>format</b> command.</p>

<p>The <b>format long</b> command displays 16 digits after decimal.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result&minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format bank</b> command rounds numbers to two decimal places. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB displays large numbers using exponential notation.</p>

<p>The <b>format short e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format long e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format rat</b> command gives the closest rational expression resulting from a calculation. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Creating Vectors</h2>

<p>A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors:</p>

<p><b>Row vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Column vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon(;) to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>

<p>In MATLAB, a matrix is created by entering each row as a sequence of space or comma separated elements, and end of a row is demarcated by a semicolon. For example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix as:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

x = 3	       % defining x and initializing it with a value
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 3
</pre>
<p>It creates a 1-by-1 matrix named <i>x</i> and stores the value 3 in its element. Let us check another example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

x = sqrt(16) 	% defining x and initializing it with an expression
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 4
</pre>
<p>Please note that &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables must have values before they are used.</p></li>
<li><p>When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

sqrt(78)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  8.8318
</pre>
<p>You can use this variable <b>ans</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

sqrt(78);
9876/ans
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  1118.2
</pre>
<p>Let's look at another example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = 7 * 8;
y = x * 7.89
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
y =  441.84
</pre>
<h2>Multiple Assignments</h2>
<p>You can have multiple assignments on the same line. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

a = 2; b = 7; c = a * b
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
c = 14
</pre>
<h2>I have forgotten the Variables!</h2>
<p>The <b>who</b> command displays all the variable names you have used.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

Total is 73 elements using 781 bytes     
</pre>
<p>The <b>clear</b> command deletes all (or the specified) variable(s) from the memory.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
clear x     % it will delete x, won't display anything
clear	      % it will delete all variables in the workspace
            %  peacefully and unobtrusively 
</pre>
<h2>Long Assignments</h2>
<p>Long assignments can be extended to another line by using an ellipses (...). For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
initial_velocity = 0;
acceleration = 9.8;
time = 20;
final_velocity = initial_velocity + acceleration * time
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>
<p>In MATLAB, a matrix is created by entering each row as a sequence of space or comma separated elements, and end of a row is demarcated by a semicolon. For example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

m = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

<title>MATLAB Commands</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Commands</h1>

<p>MATLAB is an interactive program for numerical computation and data visualization. You can enter a command by typing it at the MATLAB prompt '&gt;&gt;' on the <b>Command Window</b>.</p>

<p>In this section, we will provide lists of commonly used general MATLAB commands.</p>

<h2>Commands for Managing a Session</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various commands for managing a session. The following table provides all such commands &minus;</p>

<h2>Commands for Working with the System</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various useful commands for working with the system, like saving the current work in the workspace as a file and loading the file later.</p>

<p>It also provides various commands for other system-related activities like, displaying date, listing files in the directory, displaying current directory, etc.</p>

<p>The following table displays some commonly used system-related commands &minus;</p>

<h2>Input and Output Commands</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following input and output related commands &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>fscanf</b> and <b>fprintf</b> commands behave like C scanf and printf functions. They support the following format codes &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB M-Files</title>

<h1>MATLAB - M-Files</h1>

<p>So far, we have used MATLAB environment as a calculator. However, MATLAB is also a powerful programming language, as well as an interactive computational environment.</p>

<p>In previous chapters, you have learned how to enter commands from the MATLAB command prompt. MATLAB also allows you to write series of commands into a file and execute the file as complete unit, like writing a function and calling it.</p>

<h2>The M Files</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows writing two kinds of program files &minus;</p>

<p><b>Scripts</b> &minus; script files are program files with <b>.m extension</b>. In these files, you write series of commands, which you want to execute together. Scripts do not accept inputs and do not return any outputs. They operate on data in the workspace.</p>

<p><b>Functions</b> &minus; functions files are also program files with <b>.m extension</b>. Functions can accept inputs and return outputs. Internal variables are local to the function.</p>

<p>You can use the MATLAB editor or any other text editor to create your <b>.m</b>files. In this section, we will discuss the script files. A script file contains multiple sequential lines of MATLAB commands and function calls. You can run a script by typing its name at the command line.</p>

<h2>Creating and Running Script File</h2>

<p>To create scripts files, you need to use a text editor. You can open the MATLAB editor in two ways:</p>

<p>If you are using the command prompt, type <b>edit</b> in the command prompt. This will open the editor. You can directly type <b>edit</b> and then the filename (with .m extension)</p>

<p>The above command will create the file in default MATLAB directory. If you want to store all program files in a specific folder, then you will have to provide the entire path.</p>

<p>Let us create a folder named progs. Type the following commands at the command prompt (>>):</p>

<p>If you are creating the file for first time, MATLAB prompts you to confirm it. Click Yes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are using the IDE, choose NEW -&gt; Script. This also opens the editor and creates a file named Untitled. You can name and save the file after typing the code.</p>

<p>Type the following code in the editor &minus;</p>

<p>After creating and saving the file, you can run it in two ways &minus;</p>

<p>The command window prompt displays the result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file, and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

Or
edit &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
<p>The above command will create the file in default MATLAB directory. If you want to store all program files in a specific folder, then you will have to provide the entire path.</p>
<p>Let us create a folder named progs. Type the following commands at the command prompt (>>):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
mkdir progs    % create directory progs under default directory
chdir progs    % changing the current directory to progs
edit  prog1.m  % creating an m file named prog1.m
</pre>
<p>If you are creating the file for first time, MATLAB prompts you to confirm it. Click Yes.</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/m_files1.jpg" width="100%" alt="Creating a Script File" />
<p>Alternatively, if you are using the IDE, choose NEW -&gt; Script. This also opens the editor and creates a file named Untitled. You can name and save the file after typing the code.</p>
<p>Type the following code in the editor &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
NoOfStudents = 6000;
TeachingStaff = 150;
NonTeachingStaff = 20;
Total = NoOfStudents + TeachingStaff ...
   + NonTeachingStaff;
disp(Total);
</pre>
<p>After creating and saving the file, you can run it in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Clicking the <b>Run</b> button on the editor window or</li>
<li>Just typing the filename (without extension) in the command prompt:
&gt;&gt; prog1</li>
</ul>
<p>The command window prompt displays the result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file, and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = 5; b = 7;
c = a + b
d = c + sin(b)
e = 5 * d
f = exp(-d)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
c =  12

<title>MATLAB Data Types</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Types</h1>

<p>MATLAB does not require any type declaration or dimension statements. Whenever MATLAB encounters a new variable name, it creates the variable and allocates appropriate memory space.</p>

<p>If the variable already exists, then MATLAB replaces the original content with new content and allocates new storage space, where necessary.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>The above statement creates a 1-by-1 matrix named 'Total' and stores the value 42 in it.</p>

<h2>Data Types Available in MATLAB</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides 15 fundamental data types. Every data type stores data that is in the form of a matrix or array. The size of this matrix or array is a minimum of 0-by-0 and this can grow up to a matrix or array of any size.</p>

<p>The following table shows the most commonly used data types in MATLAB &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for converting, a value from one data type to another. The following table shows the data type conversion functions &minus;</p>

<h2>Determination of Data Types</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for identifying data type of a variable. </p>

<p>Following table provides the functions for determining the data type of a variable &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Operators</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Operators</h1>

<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. MATLAB is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays. Therefore, operators in MATLAB work both on scalar and non-scalar data. MATLAB allows the following types of elementary operations &minus;</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows two different types of arithmetic operations &minus;</p>

<p>Matrix arithmetic operations are same as defined in linear algebra. Array operations are executed element by element, both on one-dimensional and multidimensional array.</p>

<p>The matrix operators and array operators are differentiated by the period (.) symbol. However, as the addition and subtraction operation is same for matrices and arrays, the operator is same for both cases. The following table gives brief description of the operators &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_arithmetic_operators.htm" title="Arithmetic Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<p>Matrix multiplication. C = A*B is the linear algebraic product of the matrices A and B. More precisely,</p>

<p><img src="/matlab/images/matlab_arithmetic_operators1.jpg" alt="Matrix Multiplication"></p>

<p>For non-scalar A and B, the number of columns of A must be equal to the number of rows of B. A scalar can multiply a matrix of any size.</p>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>

<p>Relational operators can also work on both scalar and non-scalar data. Relational operators for arrays perform element-by-element comparisons between two arrays and return a logical array of the same size, with elements set to logical 1 (true) where the relation is true and elements set to logical 0 (false) where it is not.</p>

<p>The following table shows the relational operators available in MATLAB:</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_relational_operators.htm" title="Relational Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>MATLAB offers two types of logical operators and functions:</p>

<p>Element-wise &minus; These operators operate on corresponding elements of logical arrays.</p>

<p>Short-circuit &minus; These operators operate on scalar and, logical expressions.</p>

<p>Element-wise logical operators operate element-by-element on logical arrays. The symbols &, |, and ~ are the logical array operators AND, OR, and NOT.</p>

<p>Short-circuit logical operators allow short-circuiting on logical operations. The symbols && and || are the logical short-circuit operators AND and OR.</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_logical_operators.htm" title="Logical Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Bitwise Operations</h2>

<p>Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &amp;, |, and ^ are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows:</p>

<p>A = 0011 1100</p>

<p>B = 0000 1101</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>A&amp;B = 0000 1100</p>

<p>A|B = 0011 1101</p>

<p>A^B = 0011 0001</p>

<p>~A&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for bit-wise operations like 'bitwise and', 'bitwise or' and 'bitwise not' operations, shift operation, etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows the commonly used bitwise operations:</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_bitwise_operators.htm" title="Bitwise Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Set Operations</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for set operations, like union, intersection and testing for set membership, etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows some commonly used set operations &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_set_operators.htm" title="Set Operations in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<p>Treats each row of A and each row of B as single entities and returns the rows from A that are not in B. The rows of the returned matrix are in sorted order.</p>

<p>The 'rows' option does not support cell arrays.</p>

<title>MATLAB Decision Making</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer should specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB - Loop Types</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Loop Types</h1>

<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_nested_loops.htm" title="nested loops in MATLAB">nested loops</a></p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>MATLAB supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<title>MATLAB Vectors</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Vectors</h1>

<p>A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors &minus;</p>

<h2>Row Vectors</h2>

<p><b>Row vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Column Vectors</h2>

<p><b>Column vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Vector</h2>

<p>You can reference one or more of the elements of a vector in several ways. The i<sup>th</sup> component of a vector v is referred as v(i). For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>When you reference a vector with a colon, such as v(:), all the components of the vector are listed.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB allows you to select a range of elements from a vector.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a row vector <i>rv</i> of 9 elements, then we will reference the elements 3 to 7 by writing <i><b>rv(3:7)</b></i> and create a new vector named <i>sub_rv</i>.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Matrix</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Matrix</h1>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>

<p>In MATLAB, you create a matrix by entering elements in each row as comma or space delimited numbers and using semicolons to mark the end of each row.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a 4-by-5 matrix <i>a</i> &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Matrix</h2>

<p>To reference an element in the m<sup>th</sup> row and n<sup>th</sup> column, of a matrix <i>mx</i>, we write &minus;</p>

<p>For example, to refer to the element in the 2<sup>nd</sup> row and 5<sup>th</sup> column, of the matrix <i>a</i>, as created in the last section, we type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>To reference all the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> column we type A(:,m).</p>

<p>Let us create a column vector v, from the elements of the 4<sup>th</sup> row of the matrix a:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also select the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> through n<sup>th</sup> columns, for this we write &minus;</p>

<p>Let us create a smaller matrix taking the elements from the second and third columns &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a sub-matrix <i>sa</i> taking the inner subpart of a:</p>

<p>To do this, write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Deleting a Row or a Column in a Matrix</h2>

<p>You can delete an entire row or column of a matrix by assigning an empty set of square braces [] to that row or column. Basically, [] denotes an empty array.</p>

<p>For example, let us delete the fourth row of a &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Next, let us delete the fifth column of a &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix m, then we will copy the second and third rows of this matrix twice to create a 4-by-3 matrix.</p>

<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Arrays</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Arrays</h1>

<p>All variables of all data types in MATLAB are multidimensional arrays. A vector is a one-dimensional array and a matrix is a two-dimensional array.</p>

<p>We have already discussed vectors and matrices. In this chapter, we will discuss multidimensional arrays. However, before that, let us discuss some special types of arrays.</p>

<h2>Special Arrays in MATLAB</h2>

<p>In this section, we will discuss some functions that create some special arrays. For all these functions, a single argument creates a square array, double arguments create rectangular array.</p>

<p>The <b>zeros()</b> function creates an array of all zeros &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>ones()</b> function creates an array of all ones &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>eye()</b> function creates an identity matrix.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>rand()</b> function creates an array of uniformly distributed random numbers on (0,1) &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>A Magic Square</h2>

<p>A <b>magic square</b> is a square that produces the same sum, when its elements are added row-wise, column-wise or diagonally.</p>

<p>The <b>magic()</b> function creates a magic square array. It takes a singular argument that gives the size of the square. The argument must be a scalar greater than or equal to 3.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>An array having more than two dimensions is called a multidimensional array in MATLAB. Multidimensional arrays in MATLAB are an extension of the normal two-dimensional matrix.</p>

<p>Generally to generate a multidimensional array, we first create a two-dimensional array and extend it.</p>

<p>For example, let's create a two-dimensional array a.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The array <i>a</i> is a 3-by-3 array; we can add a third dimension to <i>a</i>, by providing the values like &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can also create multidimensional arrays using the ones(), zeros() or the rand() functions.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can also use the <b>cat()</b> function to build multidimensional arrays. It concatenates a list of arrays along a specified dimension &minus;</p>

<p>Syntax for the cat() function is &minus;</p>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><i>B</i> is the new array created</p>

<p><i>A1</i>, <i>A2</i>, ... are the arrays to be concatenated</p>

<p><i>dim</i> is the dimension along which to concatenate the arrays</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>

<h2>Array Functions</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions to sort, rotate, permute, reshape, or shift array contents. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following examples illustrate some of the functions mentioned above.</p>

<p><b>Length, Dimension and Number of elements:</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Circular Shifting of the Array Elements &minus;</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Sorting Arrays</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Cell Array</h2>

<p>Cell arrays are arrays of indexed cells where each cell can store an array of a different dimensions and data types.</p>

<p>The <b>cell</b> function is used for creating a cell array. Syntax for the cell function is &minus;</p>

<h3>Where,</h3>

<p><i>C</i> is the cell array;</p>

<p><i>dim</i> is a scalar integer or vector of integers that specifies the dimensions of cell array C;</p>

<p><i>dim1, ... , dimN</i> are scalar integers that specify the dimensions of C;</p>

<p><i>obj</i> is One of the following:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Data in Cell Arrays</h2>

<p>There are two ways to refer to the elements of a cell array &minus;</p>

<p>When you enclose the indices in first bracket, it refers to the set of cells.</p>

<p>Cell array indices in smooth parentheses refer to sets of cells.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also access the contents of cells by indexing with curly braces.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Strings</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Strings</h1>

<p>Creating a character string is quite simple in MATLAB. In fact, we have used it many times. For example, you type the following in the command prompt &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB considers all variables as arrays, and strings are considered as character arrays. Let us use the <b>whos</b> command to check the variable created above &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Interestingly, you can use numeric conversion functions like <b>uint8</b> or <b>uint16</b> to convert the characters in the string to their numeric codes. The <b>char</b> function converts the integer vector back to characters &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Rectangular Character Array</h2>

<p>The strings we have discussed so far are one-dimensional character arrays; however, we need to store more than that. We need to store more dimensional textual data in our program. This is achieved by creating rectangular character arrays.</p>

<p>Simplest way of creating a rectangular character array is by concatenating two or more one-dimensional character arrays, either vertically or horizontally as required.</p>

<p>You can combine strings vertically in either of the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator <b>[]</b> and separating each row with a semicolon (;). Please note that in this method each row must contain the same number of characters. For strings with different lengths, you should pad with space characters as needed.</p>

<p>Using the <b>char</b> function. If the strings are of different lengths, char pads the shorter strings with trailing blanks so that each row has the same number of characters.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can combine strings horizontally in either of the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator, <b>[]</b> and separating the input strings with a comma or a space. This method preserves any trailing spaces in the input arrays.</p>

<p>Using the string concatenation function, <b>strcat</b>. This method removes trailing spaces in the inputs.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Combining Strings into a Cell Array</h2>

<p>From our previous discussion, it is clear that combining strings with different lengths could be a pain as all strings in the array has to be of the same length. We have used blank spaces at the end of strings to equalize their length.</p>

<p>However, a more efficient way to combine the strings is to convert the resulting array into a cell array.</p>

<p>MATLAB cell array can hold different sizes and types of data in an array. Cell arrays provide a more flexible way to store strings of varying length.</p>

<p>The <b>cellstr</b> function converts a character array into a cell array of strings.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

</pre>
<p>Interestingly, you can use numeric conversion functions like <b>uint8</b> or <b>uint16</b> to convert the characters in the string to their numeric codes. The <b>char</b> function converts the integer vector back to characters &minus;</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

my_string = 'Tutorial''s Point';
str_ascii = uint8(my_string)        % 8-bit ascii values

<h2>Rectangular Character Array</h2>
<p>The strings we have discussed so far are one-dimensional character arrays; however, we need to store more than that. We need to store more dimensional textual data in our program. This is achieved by creating rectangular character arrays.</p>
<p>Simplest way of creating a rectangular character array is by concatenating two or more one-dimensional character arrays, either vertically or horizontally as required.</p>
<p>You can combine strings vertically in either of the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator <b>[]</b> and separating each row with a semicolon (;). Please note that in this method each row must contain the same number of characters. For strings with different lengths, you should pad with space characters as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <b>char</b> function. If the strings are of different lengths, char pads the shorter strings with trailing blanks so that each row has the same number of characters.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
doc_profile = ['Zara Ali                             '; ...
               'Sr. Surgeon                          '; ...
               'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center']
doc_profile = char('Zara Ali', 'Sr. Surgeon', ...
                   'RN Tagore Cardiology Research Center')
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
doc_profile =
Zara Ali

R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
doc_profile =
Zara Ali                            
Sr. Surgeon                         
RN Tagore Cardiology Research Center
</pre>
<p>You can combine strings horizontally in either of the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator, <b>[]</b> and separating the input strings with a comma or a space. This method preserves any trailing spaces in the input arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the string concatenation function, <b>strcat</b>. This method removes trailing spaces in the inputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
name =     'Zara Ali                             ';
position = 'Sr. Surgeon                          '; 
worksAt =  'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center';
profile = [name ', ' position ', ' worksAt]
profile = strcat(name, ', ', position, ', ', worksAt)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
profile = Zara Ali                             , Sr. Surgeon                          , R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
profile = Zara Ali,Sr. Surgeon,R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
</pre>
<h2>Combining Strings into a Cell Array</h2>
<p>From our previous discussion, it is clear that combining strings with different lengths could be a pain as all strings in the array has to be of the same length. We have used blank spaces at the end of strings to equalize their length.</p>
<p>However, a more efficient way to combine the strings is to convert the resulting array into a cell array.</p>
<p>MATLAB cell array can hold different sizes and types of data in an array. Cell arrays provide a more flexible way to store strings of varying length.</p>
<p>The <b>cellstr</b> function converts a character array into a cell array of strings.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
name =     'Zara Ali                             ';
position = 'Sr. Surgeon                          '; 
worksAt =  'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center';
profile = char(name, position, worksAt);
profile = cellstr(profile);
disp(profile)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
{

  [3,1] = R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center

<title>MATLAB Functions</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. In MATLAB, functions are defined in separate files. The name of the file and of the function should be the same.</p>

<p>Functions operate on variables within their own workspace, which is also called the <b>local workspace</b>, separate from the workspace you access at the MATLAB command prompt which is called the <b>base workspace</b>.</p>

<p>Functions can accept more than one input arguments and may return more than one output arguments.</p>

<p>Syntax of a function statement is &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following function named <i>mymax</i> should be written in a file named <i>mymax.m</i>. It takes five numbers as argument and returns the maximum of the numbers.</p>

<p>Create a function file, named mymax.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>The first line of a function starts with the keyword <b>function</b>. It gives the name of the function and order of arguments. In our example, the <i>mymax</i> function has five input arguments and one output argument.</p>

<p>The comment lines that come right after the function statement provide the help text. These lines are printed when you type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the function as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>

<p>An anonymous function is like an inline function in traditional programming languages, defined within a single MATLAB statement. It consists of a single MATLAB expression and any number of input and output arguments.</p>

<p>You can define an anonymous function right at the MATLAB command line or within a function or script.</p>

<p>This way you can create simple functions without having to create a file for them.</p>

<p>The syntax for creating an anonymous function from an expression is</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, we will write an anonymous function named power, which will take two numbers as input and return first number raised to the power of the second number.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>

<h2>Primary and Sub-Functions</h2>

<p>Any function other than an anonymous function must be defined within a file. Each function file contains a required primary function that appears first and any number of optional sub-functions that comes after the primary function and used by it.</p>

<p>Primary functions can be called from outside of the file that defines them, either from command line or from other functions, but sub-functions cannot be called from command line or other functions, outside the function file.</p>

<p>Sub-functions are visible only to the primary function and other sub-functions within the function file that defines them.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us write a function named quadratic that would calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. The function would take three inputs, the quadratic co-efficient, the linear co-efficient and the constant term. It would return the roots.</p>

<p>The function file quadratic.m will contain the primary function <i>quadratic</i> and the sub-function <i>disc</i>, which calculates the discriminant.</p>

<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic.m</i> and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Nested Functions</h2>

<p>You can define functions within the body of another function. These are called nested functions. A nested function contains any or all of the components of any other function.</p>

<p>Nested functions are defined within the scope of another function and they share access to the containing function's workspace.</p>

<p>A nested function follows the following syntax &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us rewrite the function <i>quadratic</i>, from previous example, however, this time the disc function will be a nested function.</p>

<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic2.m </i>and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Private Functions</h2>

<p>A private function is a primary function that is visible only to a limited group of other functions. If you do not want to expose the implementation of a function(s), you can create them as private functions.</p>

<p>Private functions reside in <b>subfolders</b> with the special name <b>private</b>.</p>

<p>They are visible only to functions in the parent folder.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us rewrite the <i>quadratic</i> function. This time, however, the <i>disc</i> function calculating the discriminant, will be a private function.</p>

<p>Create a subfolder named private in working directory. Store the following function file <i>disc.m </i>in it &minus;</p>

<p>Create a function quadratic3.m in your working directory and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Global Variables</h2>

<p>Global variables can be shared by more than one function. For this, you need to declare the variable as global in all the functions.</p>

<p>If you want to access that variable from the base workspace, then declare the variable at the command line.</p>

<p>The global declaration must occur before the variable is actually used in a function. It is a good practice to use capital letters for the names of global variables to distinguish them from other variables.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a function file named average.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it will display the following result &minus;</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
function [out1,out2, ..., outN] = myfun(in1,in2,in3, ..., inN)

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following function named <i>mymax</i> should be written in a file named <i>mymax.m</i>. It takes five numbers as argument and returns the maximum of the numbers.</p>

   max = n3;
end
if(n4 &gt; max)
    max = n4;
end
if(n5 &gt; max)
    max = n5;
end

<p>Let us create a function file named average.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="average">
function avg = average(nums)
global TOTAL
avg = sum(nums)/TOTAL;
end

<title>MATLAB Data Import</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Import</h1>

<p>Importing data in MATLAB means loading data from an external file. The <b>importdata</b> function allows loading various data files of different formats. It has the following five forms &minus;</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(filename)</b></p>

<p>Loads data into array A from the file denoted by <i>filename</i>.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata('-pastespecial')</b></p>

<p>Loads data from the system clipboard rather than from a file.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(___, delimiterIn)</b></p>

<p>Interprets <i>delimiterIn</i> as the column separator in ASCII file, filename, or the clipboard data. You can use <i>delimiterIn</i> with any of the input arguments in the above syntaxes.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(___, delimiterIn, headerlinesIn)</b></p>

<p>Loads data from ASCII file, filename, or the clipboard, reading numeric data starting from line <i>headerlinesIn+1</i>.</p>

<p><b>[A, delimiterOut, headerlinesOut] = importdata(___)</b></p>

<p>Returns the detected delimiter character for the input ASCII file in <i>delimiterOut</i> and the detected number of header lines in <i>headerlinesOut</i>, using any of the input arguments in the previous syntaxes.</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>Let us load and display an image file. Create a script file and type the following code in it:</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the image file. However, you must store it in the current directory.</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p>In this example, we import a text file and specify Delimiter and Column Header. Let us create a space-delimited ASCII file with column headers, named <i>weeklydata.txt</i>.</p>

<p>Our text file weeklydata.txt looks like this &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Example 3</h2>

<p>In this example, let us import data from clipboard.</p>

<p>Copy the following lines to the clipboard &minus;</p>

<p><b>Mathematics is simple</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Low-Level File I/O</h2>

<p>The <i>importdata</i> function is a high-level function. The low-level file I/O functions in MATLAB allow the most control over reading or writing data to a file. However, these functions need more detailed information about your file to work efficiently.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions for read and write operations at the byte or character level &minus;</p>

<h2>Import Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions for low-level import of text data files &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>fscanf</b> function reads formatted data in a text or ASCII file.</p>

<p>The <b>fgetl</b> and <b>fgets</b> functions read one line of a file at a time, where a newline character separates each line.</p>

<p>The <b>fread</b> function reads a stream of data at the byte or bit level. </p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We have a text data file 'myfile.txt' saved in our working directory. The file stores rainfall data for three months; June, July and August for the year 2012. </p>

<p>The data in myfile.txt contains repeated sets of time, month and rainfall measurements at five places. The header data stores the number of months M; so we have M sets of measurements.</p>

<p>The file looks like this &minus;</p>

<p>We will import data from this file and display this data. Take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Open the file with <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. </p>

<p>Describe the data in the file with <b>format specifiers</b>, such as '<b>%s</b>' for a string, '<b>%d</b>' for an integer, or '<b>%f</b>' for a floating-point number.</p>

<p>To skip literal characters in the file, include them in the format description. To skip a data field, use an asterisk ('*') in the specifier.</p>

<p>For example, to read the headers and return the single value for M, we write:</p>

<p>By default, <b>fscanf</b> reads data according to our format description until it does not find any match for the data, or it reaches the end of the file. Here we will use for loop for reading 3 sets of data and each time, it will read 7 rows and 5 columns.</p>

<p>We will create a structure named <i>mydata</i> in the workspace to store data read from the file. This structure has three fields - <i>time</i>, <i>month</i>, and <i>raindata</i> array.</p>

<title>MATLAB Data Output</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Output</h1>

<p>Data export (or output) in MATLAB means to write into files. MATLAB allows you to use your data in another application that reads ASCII files. For this, MATLAB provides several data export options.</p>

<p>You can create the following type of files:</p>

<p>Rectangular, delimited ASCII data file from an array.</p>

<p>Diary (or log) file of keystrokes and the resulting text output.</p>

<p>Specialized ASCII file using low-level functions such as fprintf.</p>

<p>MEX-file to access your C/C++ or Fortran routine that writes to a particular text file format.</p>

<p>Apart from this, you can also export data to spreadsheets.</p>

<p>There are two ways to export a numeric array as a delimited ASCII data file &minus;</p>

<p>Using the <b>save</b> function and specifying the <b>-ascii</b> qualifier</p>

<p>Using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function</p>

<p>Syntax for using the save function is:</p>

<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <b>&minus;ascii</b> is the specifier.</p>

<p>Syntax for using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function is:</p>

<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <i>dlm_char</i> is the delimiter character.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that the save -ascii command and the dlmwrite function does not work with cell arrays as input. To create a delimited ASCII file from the contents of a cell array, you can</p>

<p>Either, convert the cell array to a matrix using the <b>cell2mat</b> function</p>

<p>Or export the cell array using low-level file I/O functions.</p>

<p>If you use the <b>save</b> function to write a character array to an ASCII file, it writes the ASCII equivalent of the characters to the file.</p>

<p>For example, let us write the word 'hello' to a file &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and displays the following result. which is the characters of the string 'hello' in 8-digit ASCII format.</p>

<h2>Writing to Diary Files</h2>

<p>Diary files are activity logs of your MATLAB session. The diary function creates an exact copy of your session in a disk file, excluding graphics.</p>

<p>To turn on the diary function, type &minus;</p>

<p> Optionally, you can give the name of the log file, say &minus;</p>

<p>To turn off the diary function &minus;</p>

<p>You can open the diary file in a text editor.</p>

<h2>Exporting Data to Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>

<p>So far, we have exported numeric arrays. However, you may need to create other text files, including combinations of numeric and character data, nonrectangular output files, or files with non-ASCII encoding schemes. For these purposes, MATLAB provides the low-level <b>fprintf</b> function.</p>

<p>As in low-level I/O file activities, before exporting, you need to open or create a file with the <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. By default, fopen opens a file for read-only access. You should specify the permission to write or append, such as 'w' or 'a'.</p>

<p>After processing the file, you need to close it with <b>fclose(fid)</b> function.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
save my_data.out num_array -ascii
</pre>
<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <b>&minus;ascii</b> is the specifier.</p>
<p>Syntax for using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
dlmwrite('my_data.out', num_array, 'dlm_char')
</pre>
<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <i>dlm_char</i> is the delimiter character.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example demonstrates the concept. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
num_array = [ 1 2 3 4 ; 4 5 6 7; 7 8 9 0];
save array_data1.out num_array -ascii;
type array_data1.out
dlmwrite('array_data2.out', num_array, ' ');
type array_data2.out
</pre>

</ul>
<p>If you use the <b>save</b> function to write a character array to an ASCII file, it writes the ASCII equivalent of the characters to the file.</p>
<p>For example, let us write the word 'hello' to a file &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<h2>Writing to Diary Files</h2>
<p>Diary files are activity logs of your MATLAB session. The diary function creates an exact copy of your session in a disk file, excluding graphics.</p>
<p>To turn on the diary function, type &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
diary
</pre>
<p> Optionally, you can give the name of the log file, say &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
diary logdata.out

<p>You can open the diary file in a text editor.</p>
<h2>Exporting Data to Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>
<p>So far, we have exported numeric arrays. However, you may need to create other text files, including combinations of numeric and character data, nonrectangular output files, or files with non-ASCII encoding schemes. For these purposes, MATLAB provides the low-level <b>fprintf</b> function.</p>
<p>As in low-level I/O file activities, before exporting, you need to open or create a file with the <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. By default, fopen opens a file for read-only access. You should specify the permission to write or append, such as 'w' or 'a'.</p>
<p>After processing the file, you need to close it with <b>fclose(fid)</b> function.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
% create a matrix y, with two rows
x = 0:10:100;
y = [x; log(x)];
 
% open a file for writing
fid = fopen('logtable.txt', 'w');
 
% Table Header
fprintf(fid, 'Log     Function\n\n');
 
% print values in column order
% two values appear on each row of the file
fprintf(fid, '%f    %f\n', y);
fclose(fid);
% display the file created

<title>MATLAB Plotting</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Plotting</h1>

<p>To plot the graph of a function, you need to take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Define <b>x</b>, by specifying the <b>range of values</b> for the variable <b>x</b>, for which the function is to be plotted</p>

<p>Define the function, <b>y = f(x)</b></p>

<p>Call the <b>plot</b> command, as <b>plot(x, y)</b></p>

<p>Following example would demonstrate the concept. Let us plot the simple function <b>y = x</b> for the range of values for x from 0 to 100, with an increment of 5.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take one more example to plot the function y = x<sup>2</sup>. In this example, we will draw two graphs with the same function, but in second time, we will reduce the value of increment. Please note that as we decrease the increment, the graph becomes smoother.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Change the code file a little, reduce the increment to 5 &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB draws a smoother graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Adding Title, Labels, Grid Lines and Scaling on the Graph</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows you to add title, labels along the x-axis and y-axis, grid lines and also to adjust the axes to spruce up the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>xlabel</b> and <b>ylabel</b> commands generate labels along x-axis and y-axis.</p>

<p>The <b>title</b> command allows you to put a title on the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>grid on</b> command allows you to put the grid lines on the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>axis equal</b> command allows generating the plot with the same scale factors and the spaces on both axes.</p>

<p>The <b>axis square</b> command generates a square plot.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Multiple Functions on the Same Graph</h2>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Generating Sub-Plots</h2>

<p>When you create an array of plots in the same figure, each of these plots is called a subplot. The <b>subplot</b> command is used for creating subplots.</p>

<p>Syntax for the command is &minus;</p>

<p>where, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the number of rows and columns of the plot array and <i>p</i> specifies where to put a particular plot.</p>

<p>Each plot created with the subplot command can have its own characteristics. Following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us generate two plots &minus;</p>

<p>y = e<sup>−1.5x</sup>sin(10x)</p>

<title>MATLAB Graphics</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Graphics</h1>

<p>This chapter will continue exploring the plotting and graphics capabilities of MATLAB. We will discuss &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Bar Charts</h2>

<p>The <b>bar</b> command draws a two dimensional bar chart. Let us take up an example to demonstrate the idea.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us have an imaginary classroom with 10 students. We know the percent of marks obtained by these students are 75, 58, 90, 87, 50, 85, 92, 75, 60 and 95. We will draw the bar chart for this data.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following bar chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Contours</h2>

<p>A contour line of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value. Contour lines are used for creating contour maps by joining points of equal elevation above a given level, such as mean sea level.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides a <b>contour</b> function for drawing contour maps.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us generate a contour map that shows the contour lines for a given function g = f(x, y). This function has two variables. So, we will have to generate two independent variables, i.e., two data sets x and y. This is done by calling the <b>meshgrid</b> command.</p>

<p>The <b>meshgrid</b> command is used for generating a matrix of elements that give the range over x and y along with the specification of increment in each case.</p>

<p>Let us plot our function g = f(x, y), where −5 ≤ x ≤ 5, −3 ≤ y ≤ 3. Let us take an increment of 0.1 for both the values. The variables are set as &minus;</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to assign the function. Let our function be: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>

<p>Let us modify the code a little to spruce up the map </p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>

<h2>Three Dimensional Plots</h2>

<p>Three-dimensional plots basically display a surface defined by a function in two variables, g = f (x,y).</p>

<p>As before, to define g, we first create a set of (x,y) points over the domain of the function using the <b>meshgrid</b> command. Next, we assign the function itself. Finally, we use the <b>surf</b> command to create a surface plot.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>

<p>You can also use the <b>mesh</b> command to generate a three-dimensional surface. However, the <b>surf</b> command displays both the connecting lines and the faces of the surface in color, whereas, the <b>mesh</b> command creates a wireframe surface with colored lines connecting the defining points.</p>

<title>MATLAB Algebra</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Algebra</h1>

<p>So far, we have seen that all the examples work in MATLAB as well as its  GNU, alternatively called Octave. But for solving basic algebraic equations, both MATLAB and Octave are little different, so we will try to cover  MATLAB and Octave in separate sections.</p>

<p>We will also discuss factorizing and simplification of algebraic expressions.</p>

<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations. In its simplest form, the solve function takes the equation enclosed in quotes as an argument.</p>

<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You may even not include the right hand side of the equation &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>If the equation involves multiple symbols, then MATLAB by default assumes that you are solving for x, however, the solve function has another form &minus;</p>

<p>where, you can also mention the variable.</p>

<p>For example, let us solve the equation v – u – 3t<sup>2</sup> = 0, for v. In this case, we should write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The <b>roots</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations in Octave and you can write above examples as follows:</p>

<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. It is often used to solve quadratic equations. The function returns the roots of the equation in an array.</p>

<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0 in Octave. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Higher Order Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. For example, let us solve a cubic equation as (x-3)<sup>2</sup>(x-7) = 0</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In case of higher order equations, roots are long containing many terms. You can get the numerical value of such roots by converting them to double. The following example solves the fourth order equation x<sup>4</sup> − 7x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 5x + 9 = 0.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that the last two roots are complex numbers.</p>

<h2>Solving Higher Order Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The following example solves the fourth order equation x<sup>4</sup> − 7x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 5x + 9 = 0.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving System of Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also be used to generate solutions of systems of equations involving more than one variables. Let us take up a simple example to demonstrate this use.</p>

<p>Let us solve the equations &minus;</p>

<p>5x + 9y = 5</p>

<p>3x – 6y = 4</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In same way, you can solve larger linear systems. Consider the following set of equations &minus;</p>

<p>x + 3y -2z = 5</p>

<p>3x + 5y + 6z = 7</p>

<p>2x + 4y + 3z = 8</p>

<h2>Solving System of Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>We have a little different approach to solve a system of 'n' linear equations in 'n' unknowns. Let us take up a simple example to demonstrate this use.</p>

<p>Let us solve the equations &minus;</p>

<p>5x + 9y = 5</p>

<p>3x – 6y = 4</p>

<p>Such a system of linear equations can be written as the single matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, b is the column vector containing the right-hand side of the linear equations and x is the column vector representing the solution as shown in the below program &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In same way, you can solve larger linear systems as given below &minus;</p>

<p>x + 3y -2z = 5</p>

<p>3x + 5y + 6z = 7</p>

<p>2x + 4y + 3z = 8</p>

<h2>Expanding and Collecting Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>expand</b> and the <b>collect</b> function expands and collects an equation respectively. The following example demonstrates the concepts &minus;</p>

<p>When you work with many symbolic functions, you should declare that your variables are symbolic.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Expanding and Collecting Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>You need to have <b>symbolic</b> package, which provides <b>expand</b> and the <b>collect</b> function to expand and collect  an equation, respectively. The following example demonstrates the concepts &minus;</p>

<p>When you work with many symbolic functions, you should declare that your variables are symbolic but Octave has different approach to define symbolic variables. Notice the use of <b>Sin</b> and <b>Cos</b>, which are also defined in symbolic package.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Factorization and Simplification of Algebraic Expressions</h2>

<p>The <b>factor</b> function factorizes an expression and the <b>simplify</b> function simplifies an expression. The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Calculus</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Calculus</h1>

<p>MATLAB provides various ways for solving problems of differential and integral calculus, solving differential equations of any degree and calculation of limits. Best of all, you can easily plot the graphs of complex functions and check maxima, minima and other stationery points on a graph by solving the original function, as well as its derivative.</p>

<p>This chapter will deal with problems of calculus. In this chapter, we will discuss pre-calculus concepts i.e., calculating limits of functions and verifying the properties of limits.</p>

<p>In the next chapter <i>Differential</i>, we will compute derivative of an expression and find the local maxima and minima on a graph. We will also discuss solving differential equations.</p>

<p>Finally, in the <i>Integration</i> chapter, we will discuss integral calculus.</p>

<h2>Calculating Limits</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>limit</b> function for calculating limits. In its most basic form, the <b>limit</b> function takes expression as an argument and finds the limit of the expression as the independent variable goes to zero.</p>

<p>For example, let us calculate the limit of a function f(x) = (x<sup>3</sup> + 5)/(x<sup>4</sup> + 7), as x tends to zero.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The limit function falls in the realm of symbolic computing; you need to use the <b>syms</b> function to tell MATLAB which symbolic variables you are using.  You can also compute limit of a function, as the variable tends to some number other than zero. To calculate lim <sub>x-&gt;a</sub>(f(x)), we use the limit command with arguments. The first being the expression and the second is the number, that <i>x</i> approaches, here it is <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>For example, let us calculate limit of a function f(x) = (x-3)/(x-1), as x tends to 1.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let's take another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Calculating Limits using Octave</h2>

<h2>Verification of Basic Properties of Limits</h2>

<p>Algebraic Limit Theorem provides some basic properties of limits. These are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Let us consider two functions &minus;</p>

<p>Let us calculate the limits of the functions as x tends to 5, of both functions and verify the basic properties of limits using these two functions and MATLAB.</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Left and Right Sided Limits</h2>

<p>When a function has a discontinuity for some particular value of the variable, the limit does not exist at that point. In other words, limits of a function f(x) has discontinuity at x = a, when the value of limit, as x approaches x from left side, does not equal the value of the limit as x approaches from right side.</p>

<p>This leads to the concept of left-handed and right-handed limits. A left-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the left, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &lt; a. A right-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the right, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &gt; a. When the left-handed limit and right-handed limit are not equal, the limit does not exist.</p>

<p>Let us consider a function &minus;</p>

<p><b>f(x) = (x - 3)/|x - 3|</b></p>

<p>We will show that lim<sub>x-&gt;3</sub> f(x) does not exist. MATLAB helps us to establish this fact in two ways &minus;</p>

<p>The left-handed and right-handed limits are computed by passing the character strings 'left' and 'right' to the limit command as the last argument.</p>

<h2>Verification of Elementary Rules of Differentiation</h2>

<p>Let us briefly state various equations or rules for differentiation of functions and verify these rules. For this purpose, we will write f'(x) for a first order derivative and f"(x) for a second order derivative.</p>

<p>Following are the rules for differentiation &minus;</p>

<h3>Rule 1</h3>

<p>For any functions f and g and any real numbers a and b are the derivative of the function:</p>

<p><b>h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)</b> with respect to x is given by &minus;</p>

<p><b>h'(x) = af'(x) + bg'(x)</b></p>

<h3>Rule 2</h3>

<p>The <b>sum</b> and <b>subtraction</b> rules state that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p>(<b>f + g)' = f' + g'</b></p>

<p><b>(f - g)' = f' - g'</b></p>

<h3>Rule 3</h3>

<p>The <b>product</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p><b>(f.g)' = f'.g + g'.f</b></p>

<h3>Rule 4</h3>

<p>The <b>quotient</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p><b>(f/g)' = (f'.g - g'.f)/g<sup>2</sup></b></p>

<h3>Rule 5</h3>

<p>The <b>polynomial</b> or elementary power rule states that, if <b>y = f(x) = x<sup>n</sup></b>, then <b>f' = n. x<sup>(n-1)</sup></b></p>

<p>A direct outcome of this rule is that the derivative of any constant is zero, i.e., if <b>y = k</b>, any constant, then</p>

<p><b>f' = 0</b></p>

<h3>Rule 6</h3>

<p>The <b>chain</b> rule states that, derivative of the function of a function <b>h(x) = f(g(x))</b> with respect to x is,</p>

<p><b>h'(x)= f'(g(x)).g'(x)</b></p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Finding the Maxima and Minima of a Curve</h2>

<p>If we are searching for the local maxima and minima for a graph, we are basically looking for the highest or lowest points on the graph of the function at a particular locality, or for a particular range of values of the symbolic variable.</p>

<p>For a function y = f(x) the points on the graph where the graph has zero slope are called <b>stationary points</b>. In other words stationary points are where f'(x) = 0.</p>

<p>To find the stationary points of a function we differentiate, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve the equation.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us find the stationary points of the function f(x) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 12x + 17</p>

<p>Take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p><b>First let us enter the function and plot its graph.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent code for the above example &minus;</p>

<p><b>Our aim is to find some local maxima and minima on the graph, so let us find the local maxima and minima for the interval [-2, 2] on the graph.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent code for the above example &minus;</p>

<p><b>Next, let us compute the derivative.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Let us solve the derivative function, g, to get the values where it becomes zero.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>This agrees with our plot. So let us evaluate the function f at the critical points x = 1, -2.</b> We can substitute a value in a symbolic function by using the <b>subs</b> command.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Therefore, The minimum and maximum values on the function f(x) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 12x + 17, in the interval [-2,2] are 10 and 37.</p>

<h2>Solving Differential Equations</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>dsolve</b> command for solving differential equations symbolically.</p>

<p>The most basic form of the <b>dsolve</b> command for finding the solution to a single equation is</p>

<p>where <i>eqn</i> is a text string used to enter the equation.</p>

<p>It returns a symbolic solution with a set of arbitrary constants that MATLAB labels C1, C2, and so on. </p>

<p>You can also specify initial and boundary conditions for the problem, as comma-delimited list following the equation as &minus;</p>

<p>For the purpose of using dsolve command, <b>derivatives are indicated with a D</b>. For example, an equation like f'(t) = -2*f + cost(t) is entered as &minus;</p>

<p><b>'Df = -2*f + cos(t)'</b></p>

<p>Higher derivatives are indicated by following D by the order of the derivative.</p>

<p>For example the equation f"(x) + 2f'(x) = 5sin3x should be entered as &minus;</p>

<p><b>'D2y + 2Dy = 5*sin(3*x)'</b></p>

<p>Let us take up a simple example of a first order differential equation: y' = 5y.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take up another example of a second order differential equation as: y" - y = 0, y(0) = -1, y'(0) = 2.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Verification of Elementary Rules of Differentiation</h2>
<p>Let us briefly state various equations or rules for differentiation of functions and verify these rules. For this purpose, we will write f'(x) for a first order derivative and f"(x) for a second order derivative.</p>
<p>Following are the rules for differentiation &minus;</p>
<h3>Rule 1</h3>
<p>For any functions f and g and any real numbers a and b are the derivative of the function:</p>
<p><b>h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)</b> with respect to x is given by &minus;</p>
<p><b>h'(x) = af'(x) + bg'(x)</b></p>
<h3>Rule 2</h3>
<p>The <b>sum</b> and <b>subtraction</b> rules state that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p>(<b>f + g)' = f' + g'</b></p>
<p><b>(f - g)' = f' - g'</b></p>
<h3>Rule 3</h3>
<p>The <b>product</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p><b>(f.g)' = f'.g + g'.f</b></p>
<h3>Rule 4</h3>
<p>The <b>quotient</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p><b>(f/g)' = (f'.g - g'.f)/g<sup>2</sup></b></p>
<h3>Rule 5</h3>
<p>The <b>polynomial</b> or elementary power rule states that, if <b>y = f(x) = x<sup>n</sup></b>, then <b>f' = n. x<sup>(n-1)</sup></b></p>
<p>A direct outcome of this rule is that the derivative of any constant is zero, i.e., if <b>y = k</b>, any constant, then</p>
<p><b>f' = 0</b></p>
<h3>Rule 6</h3>
<p>The <b>chain</b> rule states that, derivative of the function of a function <b>h(x) = f(g(x))</b> with respect to x is,</p>
<p><b>h'(x)= f'(g(x)).g'(x)</b></p>

<title>MATLAB Integration</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Integration</h1>

<p>Integration deals with two essentially different types of problems.</p>

<p>In the first type, derivative of a function is given and we want to find the function. Therefore, we basically reverse the process of differentiation. This reverse process is known as anti-differentiation, or finding the primitive function, or finding an <b>indefinite integral</b>.</p>

<p>The second type of problems involve adding up a very large number of very small quantities and then taking a limit as the size of the quantities approaches zero, while the number of terms tend to infinity. This process leads to the definition of the <b>definite integral</b>.</p>

<p>Definite integrals are used for finding area, volume, center of gravity, moment of inertia, work done by a force, and in numerous other applications.</p>

<h2>Finding Indefinite Integral Using MATLAB</h2>

<p>By definition, if the derivative of a function f(x) is f'(x), then we say that an indefinite integral of f'(x) with respect to x is f(x).  For example, since the derivative (with respect to x) of x<sup>2</sup> is 2x, we can say that an indefinite integral of 2x is x<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>In symbols &minus;</p>

<p><b>f'(x<sup>2</sup>) = 2x</b>, therefore,</p>

<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup>.</b></p>

<p>Indefinite integral is not unique, because derivative of x<sup>2</sup> + c, for any value of a constant c, will also be 2x.</p>

<p>This is expressed in symbols as &minus;</p>

<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup> + c</b>.</p>

<p>Where, c is called an 'arbitrary constant'.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides an <b>int</b> command for calculating integral of an expression. To derive an expression for the indefinite integral of a function, we write &minus;</p>

<p>For example, from our previous example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statement and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>In this example, let us find the integral of some commonly used expressions. Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>Note that the <b>pretty</b> function returns an expression in a more readable format.</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding Definite Integral Using MATLAB</h2>

<p>By definition, definite integral is basically the limit of a sum. We use definite integrals to find areas such as the area between a curve and the x-axis and the area between two curves. Definite integrals can also be used in other situations, where the quantity required can be expressed as the limit of a sum.</p>

<p>The <b>int</b> function can be used for definite integration by passing the limits over which you want to calculate the integral.</p>

<p>To calculate</p>

<p>we write,</p>

<p>For example, to calculate the value of <img src="/matlab/images/integration2.jpg" alt="Example" /> we write &minus;</p>

<h2>MATLAB vs Octave</h2>

<p>Most MATLAB programs run in Octave, but some of the Octave programs may not run in MATLAB because, Octave allows some syntax that MATLAB does not.</p>

<p>For example, MATLAB supports single quotes only, but Octave supports both single and double quotes for defining strings. If you are looking for a tutorial on Octave, then  kindly go through this tutorial from beginning which covers both MATLAB as well as Octave.</p>

<h3>Compatible Examples</h3>

<p>Almost all the examples covered in this tutorial are compatible with MATLAB as well as Octave. Let's try following example in MATLAB and Octave which produces same result without any syntax changes &minus;</p>

<p>This example creates a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup>. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>

<h3>Non-compatible Examples</h3>

<p>Though all the core functionality of MATLAB is available in Octave, there are some functionality for example, Differential &amp; Integration Calculus, which does not match exactly in both the languages. This tutorial has tried to give both type of examples where they differed in their syntax.</p>

<p>Consider following example where MATLAB and Octave make use of different functions to get the area of a curve: f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> cos(x) for −4 ≤ x ≤ 9. Following is MATLAB version of the code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB plots the graph &minus;</p>

<p>The following result is displayed</p>

<p>But to give area of the same curve in Octave, you will have to make use of <b>symbolic</b> package as follows &minus;</p>

<title>MATLAB Simulink</title>

<h1>MATLAB - Simulink</h1>

<p>Simulink is a simulation and model-based design environment for dynamic and embedded systems, integrated with MATLAB. Simulink, also developed by MathWorks, is a data flow graphical programming language tool for modelling, simulating and analyzing multi-domain dynamic systems. It is basically a graphical block diagramming tool with customizable set of block libraries.</p>

<p>It allows you to incorporate MATLAB algorithms into models as well as export the simulation results into MATLAB for further analysis.</p>

<p>Simulink supports &minus;</p>

<p>There are several other add-on products provided by MathWorks and third-party hardware and software products that are available for use with Simulink.</p>

<p>The following list gives brief description of some of them &minus;</p>

<p><b>Stateflow</b> allows developing state machines and flow charts.</p>

<p><b>Simulink Coder</b> allows the generation of C source code for real-time implementation of systems automatically.</p>

<p><b>xPC Target</b> together with <b>x86-based real-time systems</b> provide an environment to simulate and test Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.</p>

<p><b>Embedded Coder</b> supports specific embedded targets.</p>

<p><b>HDL Coder</b> allows to automatically generate synthesizable VHDL and Verilog.</p>

<p><b>SimEvents</b> provides a library of graphical building blocks for modelling queuing systems.</p>

<p>Simulink is capable of systematic verification and validation of models through modelling style checking, requirements traceability and model coverage analysis.</p>

<p>Simulink Design Verifier allows you to identify design errors and to generate test case scenarios for model checking.</p>

<h2>Using Simulink</h2>

<p>To open Simulink, type in the MATLAB work space &minus;</p>

<p>Simulink opens with the <b>Library Browser</b>. The Library Browser is used for building simulation models.</p>

<p>On the left side window pane, you will find several libraries categorized on the basis of various systems, clicking on each one will display the design blocks on the right window pane.</p>

<h2>Building Models</h2>

<p>To create a new model, click the <b>New</b> button on the Library Browser's toolbar. This opens a new untitled model window.</p>

<p>A Simulink model is a block diagram.</p>

<p>Model elements are added by selecting the appropriate elements from the Library Browser and dragging them into the Model window.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can copy the model elements and paste them into the model window.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Drag and drop items from the Simulink library to make your project.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this example, two blocks will be used for the simulation - A <b>Source</b> (a signal) and a <b>Sink</b> (a scope). A signal generator (the source) generates an analog signal, which will then be graphically visualized by the scope(the sink).</p>

<p>Begin by dragging the required blocks from the library to the project window. Then, connect the blocks together which can be done by dragging connectors from connection points on one block to those of another.</p>

<p>Let us drag a 'Sine Wave' block into the model.</p>

<p>Select 'Sinks' from the library and drag a 'Scope' block into the model.</p>

<p>Drag a signal line from the output of the Sine Wave block to the input of the Scope block.</p>

<p>Run the simulation by pressing the '<b>Run</b>' button, keeping all parameters default (you can change them from the Simulation menu)</p>

<p>You should get the below graph from the scope.</p>

You can check the given installation instructions for your machine.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>MATLAB environment behaves like a super-complex calculator. You can enter commands at the >> command prompt.</p>

<p>MATLAB is an interpreted environment. In other words, you give a command and MATLAB executes it right away.</p>

<h2>Hands on Practice</h2>

<p>Type a valid expression, for example,</p>

<p>And press ENTER</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take up few more examples &minus;</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB provides some special expressions for some mathematical symbols, like pi for π, Inf for ∞, i (and j) for √-1 etc. <b>Nan</b> stands for 'not a number'.</p>

<h2>Use of Semicolon (;) in MATLAB</h2>

<p>Semicolon (;) indicates end of statement. However, if you want to suppress and hide the MATLAB output for an expression, add a semicolon after the expression.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>When you click the Execute button, or type Ctrl+E, MATLAB executes it immediately and the result returned is &minus;</p>

<h2>Adding Comments</h2>

<p>The percent symbol (%) is used for indicating a comment line. For example,</p>

<p>You can also write a block of comments using the block comment operators % {  and % }.</p>

<p>The MATLAB editor includes tools and context menu items to help you add, remove, or change the format of comments.</p>

<h2>Commonly used Operators and Special Characters</h2>

<p>MATLAB supports the following commonly used operators and special characters &minus;</p>

<h2>Special Variables and Constants</h2>

<p>MATLAB supports the following special variables and constants:</p>

<h2>Naming Variables</h2>

<p>Variable names consist of a letter followed by any number of letters, digits or underscore.</p>

<p>MATLAB is <b>case-sensitive</b>.</p>

<p>Variable names can be of any length, however, MATLAB uses only first N characters, where N is given by the function <b>namelengthmax</b>.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Work</h2>

<p>The <b>save</b> command is used for saving all the variables in the workspace, as a file with .mat extension, in the current directory.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>You can reload the file anytime later using the <b>load</b> command.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Variables</h1>

<p>In MATLAB environment, every variable is an array or matrix.</p>

<p>You can assign variables in a simple way. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>It creates a 1-by-1 matrix named <i>x</i> and stores the value 3 in its element. Let us check another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that &minus;</p>

<p>Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.</p>

<p>Variables must have values before they are used.</p>

<p>When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can use this variable <b>ans</b> &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let's look at another example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Assignments</h2>

<p>You can have multiple assignments on the same line. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>I have forgotten the Variables!</h2>

<p>The <b>who</b> command displays all the variable names you have used.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>whos</b> command displays little more about the variables &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>clear</b> command deletes all (or the specified) variable(s) from the memory.</p>

<h2>Long Assignments</h2>

<p>Long assignments can be extended to another line by using an ellipses (...). For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The format Command</h2>

<p>By default, MATLAB displays numbers with four decimal place values. This is known as <b>short format</b>.</p>

<p>However, if you want more precision, you need to use the <b>format</b> command.</p>

<p>The <b>format long</b> command displays 16 digits after decimal.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result&minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format bank</b> command rounds numbers to two decimal places. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB displays large numbers using exponential notation.</p>

<p>The <b>format short e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format long e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>format rat</b> command gives the closest rational expression resulting from a calculation. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Creating Vectors</h2>

<p>A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors:</p>

<p><b>Row vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Column vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon(;) to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>

<p>In MATLAB, a matrix is created by entering each row as a sequence of space or comma separated elements, and end of a row is demarcated by a semicolon. For example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix as:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Commands</h1>

<p>MATLAB is an interactive program for numerical computation and data visualization. You can enter a command by typing it at the MATLAB prompt '&gt;&gt;' on the <b>Command Window</b>.</p>

<p>In this section, we will provide lists of commonly used general MATLAB commands.</p>

<h2>Commands for Managing a Session</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various commands for managing a session. The following table provides all such commands &minus;</p>

<h2>Commands for Working with the System</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various useful commands for working with the system, like saving the current work in the workspace as a file and loading the file later.</p>

<p>It also provides various commands for other system-related activities like, displaying date, listing files in the directory, displaying current directory, etc.</p>

<p>The following table displays some commonly used system-related commands &minus;</p>

<h2>Input and Output Commands</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following input and output related commands &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>fscanf</b> and <b>fprintf</b> commands behave like C scanf and printf functions. They support the following format codes &minus;</p>

<p>The format function has the following forms used for numeric display &minus;</p>

<p>The following table shows various commands used for working with arrays, matrices and vectors &minus;</p>

<h2>Plotting Commands</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides numerous commands for plotting graphs. The following table shows some of the commonly used commands for plotting &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - M-Files</h1>

<p>So far, we have used MATLAB environment as a calculator. However, MATLAB is also a powerful programming language, as well as an interactive computational environment.</p>

<p>In previous chapters, you have learned how to enter commands from the MATLAB command prompt. MATLAB also allows you to write series of commands into a file and execute the file as complete unit, like writing a function and calling it.</p>

<h2>The M Files</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows writing two kinds of program files &minus;</p>

<p><b>Scripts</b> &minus; script files are program files with <b>.m extension</b>. In these files, you write series of commands, which you want to execute together. Scripts do not accept inputs and do not return any outputs. They operate on data in the workspace.</p>

<p><b>Functions</b> &minus; functions files are also program files with <b>.m extension</b>. Functions can accept inputs and return outputs. Internal variables are local to the function.</p>

<p>You can use the MATLAB editor or any other text editor to create your <b>.m</b>files. In this section, we will discuss the script files. A script file contains multiple sequential lines of MATLAB commands and function calls. You can run a script by typing its name at the command line.</p>

<h2>Creating and Running Script File</h2>

<p>To create scripts files, you need to use a text editor. You can open the MATLAB editor in two ways:</p>

<p>If you are using the command prompt, type <b>edit</b> in the command prompt. This will open the editor. You can directly type <b>edit</b> and then the filename (with .m extension)</p>

<p>The above command will create the file in default MATLAB directory. If you want to store all program files in a specific folder, then you will have to provide the entire path.</p>

<p>Let us create a folder named progs. Type the following commands at the command prompt (>>):</p>

<p>If you are creating the file for first time, MATLAB prompts you to confirm it. Click Yes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are using the IDE, choose NEW -&gt; Script. This also opens the editor and creates a file named Untitled. You can name and save the file after typing the code.</p>

<p>Type the following code in the editor &minus;</p>

<p>After creating and saving the file, you can run it in two ways &minus;</p>

<p>The command window prompt displays the result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file, and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Types</h1>

<p>MATLAB does not require any type declaration or dimension statements. Whenever MATLAB encounters a new variable name, it creates the variable and allocates appropriate memory space.</p>

<p>If the variable already exists, then MATLAB replaces the original content with new content and allocates new storage space, where necessary.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>The above statement creates a 1-by-1 matrix named 'Total' and stores the value 42 in it.</p>

<h2>Data Types Available in MATLAB</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides 15 fundamental data types. Every data type stores data that is in the form of a matrix or array. The size of this matrix or array is a minimum of 0-by-0 and this can grow up to a matrix or array of any size.</p>

<p>The following table shows the most commonly used data types in MATLAB &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for converting, a value from one data type to another. The following table shows the data type conversion functions &minus;</p>

<h2>Determination of Data Types</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for identifying data type of a variable. </p>

<p>Following table provides the functions for determining the data type of a variable &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Operators</h1>

<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. MATLAB is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays. Therefore, operators in MATLAB work both on scalar and non-scalar data. MATLAB allows the following types of elementary operations &minus;</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows two different types of arithmetic operations &minus;</p>

<p>Matrix arithmetic operations are same as defined in linear algebra. Array operations are executed element by element, both on one-dimensional and multidimensional array.</p>

<p>The matrix operators and array operators are differentiated by the period (.) symbol. However, as the addition and subtraction operation is same for matrices and arrays, the operator is same for both cases. The following table gives brief description of the operators &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_arithmetic_operators.htm" title="Arithmetic Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<p>Matrix multiplication. C = A*B is the linear algebraic product of the matrices A and B. More precisely,</p>

<p><img src="/matlab/images/matlab_arithmetic_operators1.jpg" alt="Matrix Multiplication"></p>

<p>For non-scalar A and B, the number of columns of A must be equal to the number of rows of B. A scalar can multiply a matrix of any size.</p>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>

<p>Relational operators can also work on both scalar and non-scalar data. Relational operators for arrays perform element-by-element comparisons between two arrays and return a logical array of the same size, with elements set to logical 1 (true) where the relation is true and elements set to logical 0 (false) where it is not.</p>

<p>The following table shows the relational operators available in MATLAB:</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_relational_operators.htm" title="Relational Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>MATLAB offers two types of logical operators and functions:</p>

<p>Element-wise &minus; These operators operate on corresponding elements of logical arrays.</p>

<p>Short-circuit &minus; These operators operate on scalar and, logical expressions.</p>

<p>Element-wise logical operators operate element-by-element on logical arrays. The symbols &, |, and ~ are the logical array operators AND, OR, and NOT.</p>

<p>Short-circuit logical operators allow short-circuiting on logical operations. The symbols && and || are the logical short-circuit operators AND and OR.</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_logical_operators.htm" title="Logical Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Bitwise Operations</h2>

<p>Bitwise operators work on bits and perform bit-by-bit operation. The truth tables for &amp;, |, and ^ are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Assume if A = 60; and B = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows:</p>

<p>A = 0011 1100</p>

<p>B = 0000 1101</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>A&amp;B = 0000 1100</p>

<p>A|B = 0011 1101</p>

<p>A^B = 0011 0001</p>

<p>~A&nbsp; = 1100 0011</p>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for bit-wise operations like 'bitwise and', 'bitwise or' and 'bitwise not' operations, shift operation, etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows the commonly used bitwise operations:</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_bitwise_operators.htm" title="Bitwise Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<h2>Set Operations</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides various functions for set operations, like union, intersection and testing for set membership, etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows some commonly used set operations &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_set_operators.htm" title="Set Operations in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>

<p>Treats each row of A and each row of B as single entities and returns the rows from A that are not in B. The rows of the returned matrix are in sorted order.</p>

<p>The 'rows' option does not support cell arrays.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer should specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB provides following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Loop Types</h1>

<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_nested_loops.htm" title="nested loops in MATLAB">nested loops</a></p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>MATLAB supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p><b>Column vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit the elements.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Vector</h2>

<p>You can reference one or more of the elements of a vector in several ways. The i<sup>th</sup> component of a vector v is referred as v(i). For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>When you reference a vector with a colon, such as v(:), all the components of the vector are listed.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB allows you to select a range of elements from a vector.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a row vector <i>rv</i> of 9 elements, then we will reference the elements 3 to 7 by writing <i><b>rv(3:7)</b></i> and create a new vector named <i>sub_rv</i>.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Matrix</h1>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>

<p>In MATLAB, you create a matrix by entering elements in each row as comma or space delimited numbers and using semicolons to mark the end of each row.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a 4-by-5 matrix <i>a</i> &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Matrix</h2>

<p>To reference an element in the m<sup>th</sup> row and n<sup>th</sup> column, of a matrix <i>mx</i>, we write &minus;</p>

<p>For example, to refer to the element in the 2<sup>nd</sup> row and 5<sup>th</sup> column, of the matrix <i>a</i>, as created in the last section, we type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>To reference all the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> column we type A(:,m).</p>

<p>Let us create a column vector v, from the elements of the 4<sup>th</sup> row of the matrix a:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also select the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> through n<sup>th</sup> columns, for this we write &minus;</p>

<p>Let us create a smaller matrix taking the elements from the second and third columns &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a sub-matrix <i>sa</i> taking the inner subpart of a:</p>

<p>To do this, write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Deleting a Row or a Column in a Matrix</h2>

<p>You can delete an entire row or column of a matrix by assigning an empty set of square braces [] to that row or column. Basically, [] denotes an empty array.</p>

<p>For example, let us delete the fourth row of a &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Next, let us delete the fifth column of a &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix m, then we will copy the second and third rows of this matrix twice to create a 4-by-3 matrix.</p>

<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Arrays</h1>

<p>All variables of all data types in MATLAB are multidimensional arrays. A vector is a one-dimensional array and a matrix is a two-dimensional array.</p>

<p>We have already discussed vectors and matrices. In this chapter, we will discuss multidimensional arrays. However, before that, let us discuss some special types of arrays.</p>

<h2>Special Arrays in MATLAB</h2>

<p>In this section, we will discuss some functions that create some special arrays. For all these functions, a single argument creates a square array, double arguments create rectangular array.</p>

<p>The <b>zeros()</b> function creates an array of all zeros &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>ones()</b> function creates an array of all ones &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>eye()</b> function creates an identity matrix.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>rand()</b> function creates an array of uniformly distributed random numbers on (0,1) &minus;</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>A Magic Square</h2>

<p>A <b>magic square</b> is a square that produces the same sum, when its elements are added row-wise, column-wise or diagonally.</p>

<p>The <b>magic()</b> function creates a magic square array. It takes a singular argument that gives the size of the square. The argument must be a scalar greater than or equal to 3.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>An array having more than two dimensions is called a multidimensional array in MATLAB. Multidimensional arrays in MATLAB are an extension of the normal two-dimensional matrix.</p>

<p>Generally to generate a multidimensional array, we first create a two-dimensional array and extend it.</p>

<p>For example, let's create a two-dimensional array a.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The array <i>a</i> is a 3-by-3 array; we can add a third dimension to <i>a</i>, by providing the values like &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can also create multidimensional arrays using the ones(), zeros() or the rand() functions.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can also use the <b>cat()</b> function to build multidimensional arrays. It concatenates a list of arrays along a specified dimension &minus;</p>

<p>Syntax for the cat() function is &minus;</p>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><i>B</i> is the new array created</p>

<p><i>A1</i>, <i>A2</i>, ... are the arrays to be concatenated</p>

<p><i>dim</i> is the dimension along which to concatenate the arrays</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>

<h2>Array Functions</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions to sort, rotate, permute, reshape, or shift array contents. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following examples illustrate some of the functions mentioned above.</p>

<p><b>Length, Dimension and Number of elements:</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Circular Shifting of the Array Elements &minus;</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Sorting Arrays</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Cell Array</h2>

<p>Cell arrays are arrays of indexed cells where each cell can store an array of a different dimensions and data types.</p>

<p>The <b>cell</b> function is used for creating a cell array. Syntax for the cell function is &minus;</p>

<h3>Where,</h3>

<p><i>C</i> is the cell array;</p>

<p><i>dim</i> is a scalar integer or vector of integers that specifies the dimensions of cell array C;</p>

<p><i>dim1, ... , dimN</i> are scalar integers that specify the dimensions of C;</p>

<p><i>obj</i> is One of the following:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Data in Cell Arrays</h2>

<p>There are two ways to refer to the elements of a cell array &minus;</p>

<p>When you enclose the indices in first bracket, it refers to the set of cells.</p>

<p>Cell array indices in smooth parentheses refer to sets of cells.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also access the contents of cells by indexing with curly braces.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Colon Notation</h1>

<p>The <b>colon(:)</b> is one of the most useful operator in MATLAB. It is used to create vectors, subscript arrays, and <b>specify for iterations</b>.</p>

<p>If you want to create a row vector, containing integers from 1 to 10, you write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the statement and returns a row vector containing the integers from 1 to 10 &minus;</p>

<p>If you want to specify an increment value other than one, for example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the statement and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take another example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the statement and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can use the colon operator to create a vector of indices to select rows, columns or elements of arrays.</p>

<p>The following table describes its use for this purpose (let us have a matrix A) &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Numbers</h1>

<p>MATLAB supports various numeric classes that include signed and unsigned integers and single-precision and double-precision floating-point numbers. By default, MATLAB stores all numeric values as double-precision floating point numbers.</p>

<p>You can choose to store any number or array of numbers as integers or as single-precision numbers.</p>

<p>All numeric types support basic array operations and mathematical operations.</p>

<h2>Conversion to Various Numeric Data Types</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions to convert to various numeric data types &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it shows the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us extend the previous example a little more. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it shows the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Smallest and Largest Integers</h2>

<p>The functions <b>intmax()</b> and <b>intmin()</b> return the maximum and minimum values that can be represented with all types of integer numbers.</p>

<p>Both the functions take the integer data type as the argument, for example, intmax(int8) or intmin(int64) and return the maximum and minimum values that you can represent with the integer data type.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example illustrates how to obtain the smallest and largest values of integers. Create a script file and write the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it shows the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Smallest and Largest Floating Point Numbers</h2>

<p>The functions <b>realmax()</b> and <b>realmin()</b> return the maximum and minimum values that can be represented with floating point numbers.</p>

<p>Both the functions when called with the argument 'single', return the maximum and minimum values that you can represent with the single-precision data type and when called with the argument 'double', return the maximum and minimum values that you can represent with the double-precision data type.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example illustrates how to obtain the smallest and largest floating point numbers. Create a script file and write the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Strings</h1>

<p>Creating a character string is quite simple in MATLAB. In fact, we have used it many times. For example, you type the following in the command prompt &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB considers all variables as arrays, and strings are considered as character arrays. Let us use the <b>whos</b> command to check the variable created above &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Interestingly, you can use numeric conversion functions like <b>uint8</b> or <b>uint16</b> to convert the characters in the string to their numeric codes. The <b>char</b> function converts the integer vector back to characters &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Rectangular Character Array</h2>

<p>The strings we have discussed so far are one-dimensional character arrays; however, we need to store more than that. We need to store more dimensional textual data in our program. This is achieved by creating rectangular character arrays.</p>

<p>Simplest way of creating a rectangular character array is by concatenating two or more one-dimensional character arrays, either vertically or horizontally as required.</p>

<p>You can combine strings vertically in either of the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator <b>[]</b> and separating each row with a semicolon (;). Please note that in this method each row must contain the same number of characters. For strings with different lengths, you should pad with space characters as needed.</p>

<p>Using the <b>char</b> function. If the strings are of different lengths, char pads the shorter strings with trailing blanks so that each row has the same number of characters.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can combine strings horizontally in either of the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator, <b>[]</b> and separating the input strings with a comma or a space. This method preserves any trailing spaces in the input arrays.</p>

<p>Using the string concatenation function, <b>strcat</b>. This method removes trailing spaces in the inputs.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Combining Strings into a Cell Array</h2>

<p>From our previous discussion, it is clear that combining strings with different lengths could be a pain as all strings in the array has to be of the same length. We have used blank spaces at the end of strings to equalize their length.</p>

<p>However, a more efficient way to combine the strings is to convert the resulting array into a cell array.</p>

<p>MATLAB cell array can hold different sizes and types of data in an array. Cell arrays provide a more flexible way to store strings of varying length.</p>

<p>The <b>cellstr</b> function converts a character array into a cell array of strings.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>String Functions in MATLAB</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides numerous string functions creating, combining, parsing, comparing and manipulating strings.</p>

<p>Following table provides brief description of the string functions in MATLAB &minus;</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The following examples illustrate some of the above-mentioned string functions &minus;</p>

<h4>Formatting Strings</h4>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h4>Comparing Strings</h4>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. In MATLAB, functions are defined in separate files. The name of the file and of the function should be the same.</p>

<p>Functions operate on variables within their own workspace, which is also called the <b>local workspace</b>, separate from the workspace you access at the MATLAB command prompt which is called the <b>base workspace</b>.</p>

<p>Functions can accept more than one input arguments and may return more than one output arguments.</p>

<p>Syntax of a function statement is &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following function named <i>mymax</i> should be written in a file named <i>mymax.m</i>. It takes five numbers as argument and returns the maximum of the numbers.</p>

<p>Create a function file, named mymax.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>The first line of a function starts with the keyword <b>function</b>. It gives the name of the function and order of arguments. In our example, the <i>mymax</i> function has five input arguments and one output argument.</p>

<p>The comment lines that come right after the function statement provide the help text. These lines are printed when you type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the function as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>

<p>An anonymous function is like an inline function in traditional programming languages, defined within a single MATLAB statement. It consists of a single MATLAB expression and any number of input and output arguments.</p>

<p>You can define an anonymous function right at the MATLAB command line or within a function or script.</p>

<p>This way you can create simple functions without having to create a file for them.</p>

<p>The syntax for creating an anonymous function from an expression is</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, we will write an anonymous function named power, which will take two numbers as input and return first number raised to the power of the second number.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>

<h2>Primary and Sub-Functions</h2>

<p>Any function other than an anonymous function must be defined within a file. Each function file contains a required primary function that appears first and any number of optional sub-functions that comes after the primary function and used by it.</p>

<p>Primary functions can be called from outside of the file that defines them, either from command line or from other functions, but sub-functions cannot be called from command line or other functions, outside the function file.</p>

<p>Sub-functions are visible only to the primary function and other sub-functions within the function file that defines them.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us write a function named quadratic that would calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. The function would take three inputs, the quadratic co-efficient, the linear co-efficient and the constant term. It would return the roots.</p>

<p>The function file quadratic.m will contain the primary function <i>quadratic</i> and the sub-function <i>disc</i>, which calculates the discriminant.</p>

<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic.m</i> and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Nested Functions</h2>

<p>You can define functions within the body of another function. These are called nested functions. A nested function contains any or all of the components of any other function.</p>

<p>Nested functions are defined within the scope of another function and they share access to the containing function's workspace.</p>

<p>A nested function follows the following syntax &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us rewrite the function <i>quadratic</i>, from previous example, however, this time the disc function will be a nested function.</p>

<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic2.m </i>and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Private Functions</h2>

<p>A private function is a primary function that is visible only to a limited group of other functions. If you do not want to expose the implementation of a function(s), you can create them as private functions.</p>

<p>Private functions reside in <b>subfolders</b> with the special name <b>private</b>.</p>

<p>They are visible only to functions in the parent folder.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us rewrite the <i>quadratic</i> function. This time, however, the <i>disc</i> function calculating the discriminant, will be a private function.</p>

<p>Create a subfolder named private in working directory. Store the following function file <i>disc.m </i>in it &minus;</p>

<p>Create a function quadratic3.m in your working directory and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Global Variables</h2>

<p>Global variables can be shared by more than one function. For this, you need to declare the variable as global in all the functions.</p>

<p>If you want to access that variable from the base workspace, then declare the variable at the command line.</p>

<p>The global declaration must occur before the variable is actually used in a function. It is a good practice to use capital letters for the names of global variables to distinguish them from other variables.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a function file named average.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it will display the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Import</h1>

<p>Importing data in MATLAB means loading data from an external file. The <b>importdata</b> function allows loading various data files of different formats. It has the following five forms &minus;</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(filename)</b></p>

<p>Loads data into array A from the file denoted by <i>filename</i>.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata('-pastespecial')</b></p>

<p>Loads data from the system clipboard rather than from a file.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(___, delimiterIn)</b></p>

<p>Interprets <i>delimiterIn</i> as the column separator in ASCII file, filename, or the clipboard data. You can use <i>delimiterIn</i> with any of the input arguments in the above syntaxes.</p>

<p><b>A = importdata(___, delimiterIn, headerlinesIn)</b></p>

<p>Loads data from ASCII file, filename, or the clipboard, reading numeric data starting from line <i>headerlinesIn+1</i>.</p>

<p><b>[A, delimiterOut, headerlinesOut] = importdata(___)</b></p>

<p>Returns the detected delimiter character for the input ASCII file in <i>delimiterOut</i> and the detected number of header lines in <i>headerlinesOut</i>, using any of the input arguments in the previous syntaxes.</p>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>Let us load and display an image file. Create a script file and type the following code in it:</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the image file. However, you must store it in the current directory.</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p>In this example, we import a text file and specify Delimiter and Column Header. Let us create a space-delimited ASCII file with column headers, named <i>weeklydata.txt</i>.</p>

<p>Our text file weeklydata.txt looks like this &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Example 3</h2>

<p>In this example, let us import data from clipboard.</p>

<p>Copy the following lines to the clipboard &minus;</p>

<p><b>Mathematics is simple</b></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Low-Level File I/O</h2>

<p>The <i>importdata</i> function is a high-level function. The low-level file I/O functions in MATLAB allow the most control over reading or writing data to a file. However, these functions need more detailed information about your file to work efficiently.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions for read and write operations at the byte or character level &minus;</p>

<h2>Import Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the following functions for low-level import of text data files &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>fscanf</b> function reads formatted data in a text or ASCII file.</p>

<p>The <b>fgetl</b> and <b>fgets</b> functions read one line of a file at a time, where a newline character separates each line.</p>

<p>The <b>fread</b> function reads a stream of data at the byte or bit level. </p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We have a text data file 'myfile.txt' saved in our working directory. The file stores rainfall data for three months; June, July and August for the year 2012. </p>

<p>The data in myfile.txt contains repeated sets of time, month and rainfall measurements at five places. The header data stores the number of months M; so we have M sets of measurements.</p>

<p>The file looks like this &minus;</p>

<p>We will import data from this file and display this data. Take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Open the file with <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. </p>

<p>Describe the data in the file with <b>format specifiers</b>, such as '<b>%s</b>' for a string, '<b>%d</b>' for an integer, or '<b>%f</b>' for a floating-point number.</p>

<p>To skip literal characters in the file, include them in the format description. To skip a data field, use an asterisk ('*') in the specifier.</p>

<p>For example, to read the headers and return the single value for M, we write:</p>

<p>By default, <b>fscanf</b> reads data according to our format description until it does not find any match for the data, or it reaches the end of the file. Here we will use for loop for reading 3 sets of data and each time, it will read 7 rows and 5 columns.</p>

<p>We will create a structure named <i>mydata</i> in the workspace to store data read from the file. This structure has three fields - <i>time</i>, <i>month</i>, and <i>raindata</i> array.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Output</h1>

<p>Data export (or output) in MATLAB means to write into files. MATLAB allows you to use your data in another application that reads ASCII files. For this, MATLAB provides several data export options.</p>

<p>You can create the following type of files:</p>

<p>Rectangular, delimited ASCII data file from an array.</p>

<p>Diary (or log) file of keystrokes and the resulting text output.</p>

<p>Specialized ASCII file using low-level functions such as fprintf.</p>

<p>MEX-file to access your C/C++ or Fortran routine that writes to a particular text file format.</p>

<p>Apart from this, you can also export data to spreadsheets.</p>

<p>There are two ways to export a numeric array as a delimited ASCII data file &minus;</p>

<p>Using the <b>save</b> function and specifying the <b>-ascii</b> qualifier</p>

<p>Using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function</p>

<p>Syntax for using the save function is:</p>

<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <b>&minus;ascii</b> is the specifier.</p>

<p>Syntax for using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function is:</p>

<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <i>dlm_char</i> is the delimiter character.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that the save -ascii command and the dlmwrite function does not work with cell arrays as input. To create a delimited ASCII file from the contents of a cell array, you can</p>

<p>Either, convert the cell array to a matrix using the <b>cell2mat</b> function</p>

<p>Or export the cell array using low-level file I/O functions.</p>

<p>If you use the <b>save</b> function to write a character array to an ASCII file, it writes the ASCII equivalent of the characters to the file.</p>

<p>For example, let us write the word 'hello' to a file &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and displays the following result. which is the characters of the string 'hello' in 8-digit ASCII format.</p>

<h2>Writing to Diary Files</h2>

<p>Diary files are activity logs of your MATLAB session. The diary function creates an exact copy of your session in a disk file, excluding graphics.</p>

<p>To turn on the diary function, type &minus;</p>

<p> Optionally, you can give the name of the log file, say &minus;</p>

<p>To turn off the diary function &minus;</p>

<p>You can open the diary file in a text editor.</p>

<h2>Exporting Data to Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>

<p>So far, we have exported numeric arrays. However, you may need to create other text files, including combinations of numeric and character data, nonrectangular output files, or files with non-ASCII encoding schemes. For these purposes, MATLAB provides the low-level <b>fprintf</b> function.</p>

<p>As in low-level I/O file activities, before exporting, you need to open or create a file with the <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. By default, fopen opens a file for read-only access. You should specify the permission to write or append, such as 'w' or 'a'.</p>

<p>After processing the file, you need to close it with <b>fclose(fid)</b> function.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Plotting</h1>

<p>To plot the graph of a function, you need to take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Define <b>x</b>, by specifying the <b>range of values</b> for the variable <b>x</b>, for which the function is to be plotted</p>

<p>Define the function, <b>y = f(x)</b></p>

<p>Call the <b>plot</b> command, as <b>plot(x, y)</b></p>

<p>Following example would demonstrate the concept. Let us plot the simple function <b>y = x</b> for the range of values for x from 0 to 100, with an increment of 5.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take one more example to plot the function y = x<sup>2</sup>. In this example, we will draw two graphs with the same function, but in second time, we will reduce the value of increment. Please note that as we decrease the increment, the graph becomes smoother.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Change the code file a little, reduce the increment to 5 &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB draws a smoother graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Adding Title, Labels, Grid Lines and Scaling on the Graph</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows you to add title, labels along the x-axis and y-axis, grid lines and also to adjust the axes to spruce up the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>xlabel</b> and <b>ylabel</b> commands generate labels along x-axis and y-axis.</p>

<p>The <b>title</b> command allows you to put a title on the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>grid on</b> command allows you to put the grid lines on the graph.</p>

<p>The <b>axis equal</b> command allows generating the plot with the same scale factors and the spaces on both axes.</p>

<p>The <b>axis square</b> command generates a square plot.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Multiple Functions on the Same Graph</h2>

<p>You can draw multiple graphs on the same plot. The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Setting Colors on Graph</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides eight basic color options for drawing graphs. The following table shows the colors and their codes &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us draw the graph of two polynomials</p>

<p>f(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup> + 2x<sup>3</sup>+ 7x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 9 and</p>

<p>g(x) = 5x<sup>3</sup> + 9x + 2</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Setting Axis Scales</h2>

<p>The <b>axis</b> command allows you to set the axis scales. You can provide minimum and maximum values for x and y axes using the axis command in the following way:</p>

<p>The following example shows this &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Generating Sub-Plots</h2>

<p>When you create an array of plots in the same figure, each of these plots is called a subplot. The <b>subplot</b> command is used for creating subplots.</p>

<p>Syntax for the command is &minus;</p>

<p>where, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the number of rows and columns of the plot array and <i>p</i> specifies where to put a particular plot.</p>

<p>Each plot created with the subplot command can have its own characteristics. Following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us generate two plots &minus;</p>

<p>y = e<sup>−1.5x</sup>sin(10x)</p>

<p>y = e<sup>−2x</sup>sin(10x)</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Graphics</h1>

<p>This chapter will continue exploring the plotting and graphics capabilities of MATLAB. We will discuss &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Bar Charts</h2>

<p>The <b>bar</b> command draws a two dimensional bar chart. Let us take up an example to demonstrate the idea.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us have an imaginary classroom with 10 students. We know the percent of marks obtained by these students are 75, 58, 90, 87, 50, 85, 92, 75, 60 and 95. We will draw the bar chart for this data.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following bar chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Drawing Contours</h2>

<p>A contour line of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value. Contour lines are used for creating contour maps by joining points of equal elevation above a given level, such as mean sea level.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides a <b>contour</b> function for drawing contour maps.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us generate a contour map that shows the contour lines for a given function g = f(x, y). This function has two variables. So, we will have to generate two independent variables, i.e., two data sets x and y. This is done by calling the <b>meshgrid</b> command.</p>

<p>The <b>meshgrid</b> command is used for generating a matrix of elements that give the range over x and y along with the specification of increment in each case.</p>

<p>Let us plot our function g = f(x, y), where −5 ≤ x ≤ 5, −3 ≤ y ≤ 3. Let us take an increment of 0.1 for both the values. The variables are set as &minus;</p>

<p>Lastly, we need to assign the function. Let our function be: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>

<p>Let us modify the code a little to spruce up the map </p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>

<h2>Three Dimensional Plots</h2>

<p>Three-dimensional plots basically display a surface defined by a function in two variables, g = f (x,y).</p>

<p>As before, to define g, we first create a set of (x,y) points over the domain of the function using the <b>meshgrid</b> command. Next, we assign the function itself. Finally, we use the <b>surf</b> command to create a surface plot.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup></p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>

<p>You can also use the <b>mesh</b> command to generate a three-dimensional surface. However, the <b>surf</b> command displays both the connecting lines and the faces of the surface in color, whereas, the <b>mesh</b> command creates a wireframe surface with colored lines connecting the defining points.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Algebra</h1>

<p>So far, we have seen that all the examples work in MATLAB as well as its  GNU, alternatively called Octave. But for solving basic algebraic equations, both MATLAB and Octave are little different, so we will try to cover  MATLAB and Octave in separate sections.</p>

<p>We will also discuss factorizing and simplification of algebraic expressions.</p>

<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations. In its simplest form, the solve function takes the equation enclosed in quotes as an argument.</p>

<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You may even not include the right hand side of the equation &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>If the equation involves multiple symbols, then MATLAB by default assumes that you are solving for x, however, the solve function has another form &minus;</p>

<p>where, you can also mention the variable.</p>

<p>For example, let us solve the equation v – u – 3t<sup>2</sup> = 0, for v. In this case, we should write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The <b>roots</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations in Octave and you can write above examples as follows:</p>

<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. It is often used to solve quadratic equations. The function returns the roots of the equation in an array.</p>

<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0 in Octave. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving Higher Order Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. For example, let us solve a cubic equation as (x-3)<sup>2</sup>(x-7) = 0</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In case of higher order equations, roots are long containing many terms. You can get the numerical value of such roots by converting them to double. The following example solves the fourth order equation x<sup>4</sup> − 7x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 5x + 9 = 0.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Please note that the last two roots are complex numbers.</p>

<h2>Solving Higher Order Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>The following example solves the fourth order equation x<sup>4</sup> − 7x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 5x + 9 = 0.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Solving System of Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also be used to generate solutions of systems of equations involving more than one variables. Let us take up a simple example to demonstrate this use.</p>

<p>Let us solve the equations &minus;</p>

<p>5x + 9y = 5</p>

<p>3x – 6y = 4</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In same way, you can solve larger linear systems. Consider the following set of equations &minus;</p>

<p>x + 3y -2z = 5</p>

<p>3x + 5y + 6z = 7</p>

<p>2x + 4y + 3z = 8</p>

<h2>Solving System of Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>We have a little different approach to solve a system of 'n' linear equations in 'n' unknowns. Let us take up a simple example to demonstrate this use.</p>

<p>Let us solve the equations &minus;</p>

<p>5x + 9y = 5</p>

<p>3x – 6y = 4</p>

<p>Such a system of linear equations can be written as the single matrix equation Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, b is the column vector containing the right-hand side of the linear equations and x is the column vector representing the solution as shown in the below program &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In same way, you can solve larger linear systems as given below &minus;</p>

<p>x + 3y -2z = 5</p>

<p>3x + 5y + 6z = 7</p>

<p>2x + 4y + 3z = 8</p>

<h2>Expanding and Collecting Equations in MATLAB</h2>

<p>The <b>expand</b> and the <b>collect</b> function expands and collects an equation respectively. The following example demonstrates the concepts &minus;</p>

<p>When you work with many symbolic functions, you should declare that your variables are symbolic.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Expanding and Collecting Equations in Octave</h2>

<p>You need to have <b>symbolic</b> package, which provides <b>expand</b> and the <b>collect</b> function to expand and collect  an equation, respectively. The following example demonstrates the concepts &minus;</p>

<p>When you work with many symbolic functions, you should declare that your variables are symbolic but Octave has different approach to define symbolic variables. Notice the use of <b>Sin</b> and <b>Cos</b>, which are also defined in symbolic package.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Factorization and Simplification of Algebraic Expressions</h2>

<p>The <b>factor</b> function factorizes an expression and the <b>simplify</b> function simplifies an expression. The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Calculus</h1>

<p>MATLAB provides various ways for solving problems of differential and integral calculus, solving differential equations of any degree and calculation of limits. Best of all, you can easily plot the graphs of complex functions and check maxima, minima and other stationery points on a graph by solving the original function, as well as its derivative.</p>

<p>This chapter will deal with problems of calculus. In this chapter, we will discuss pre-calculus concepts i.e., calculating limits of functions and verifying the properties of limits.</p>

<p>In the next chapter <i>Differential</i>, we will compute derivative of an expression and find the local maxima and minima on a graph. We will also discuss solving differential equations.</p>

<p>Finally, in the <i>Integration</i> chapter, we will discuss integral calculus.</p>

<h2>Calculating Limits</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>limit</b> function for calculating limits. In its most basic form, the <b>limit</b> function takes expression as an argument and finds the limit of the expression as the independent variable goes to zero.</p>

<p>For example, let us calculate the limit of a function f(x) = (x<sup>3</sup> + 5)/(x<sup>4</sup> + 7), as x tends to zero.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The limit function falls in the realm of symbolic computing; you need to use the <b>syms</b> function to tell MATLAB which symbolic variables you are using.  You can also compute limit of a function, as the variable tends to some number other than zero. To calculate lim <sub>x-&gt;a</sub>(f(x)), we use the limit command with arguments. The first being the expression and the second is the number, that <i>x</i> approaches, here it is <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>For example, let us calculate limit of a function f(x) = (x-3)/(x-1), as x tends to 1.</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let's take another example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Calculating Limits using Octave</h2>

<p>Following is Octave version of the above example using <b>symbolic</b> package, try to execute and compare the result &minus;</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Verification of Basic Properties of Limits</h2>

<p>Algebraic Limit Theorem provides some basic properties of limits. These are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Let us consider two functions &minus;</p>

<p>Let us calculate the limits of the functions as x tends to 5, of both functions and verify the basic properties of limits using these two functions and MATLAB.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>

<h2>Verification of Basic Properties of Limits using Octave</h2>

<p>Following is Octave version of the above example using <b>symbolic</b> package, try to execute and compare the result &minus;</p>

<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Left and Right Sided Limits</h2>

<p>When a function has a discontinuity for some particular value of the variable, the limit does not exist at that point. In other words, limits of a function f(x) has discontinuity at x = a, when the value of limit, as x approaches x from left side, does not equal the value of the limit as x approaches from right side.</p>

<p>This leads to the concept of left-handed and right-handed limits. A left-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the left, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &lt; a. A right-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the right, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &gt; a. When the left-handed limit and right-handed limit are not equal, the limit does not exist.</p>

<p>Let us consider a function &minus;</p>

<p><b>f(x) = (x - 3)/|x - 3|</b></p>

<p>We will show that lim<sub>x-&gt;3</sub> f(x) does not exist. MATLAB helps us to establish this fact in two ways &minus;</p>

<p>The left-handed and right-handed limits are computed by passing the character strings 'left' and 'right' to the limit command as the last argument.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB draws the following plot</p>

<p>After this following output is displayed &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Differential</h1>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>diff</b> command for computing symbolic derivatives. In its simplest form, you pass the function you want to differentiate to diff command as an argument.</p>

<p>For example, let us compute the derivative of the function f(t) = 3t<sup>2</sup> + 2t<sup>-2</sup></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Verification of Elementary Rules of Differentiation</h2>

<p>Let us briefly state various equations or rules for differentiation of functions and verify these rules. For this purpose, we will write f'(x) for a first order derivative and f"(x) for a second order derivative.</p>

<p>Following are the rules for differentiation &minus;</p>

<h3>Rule 1</h3>

<p>For any functions f and g and any real numbers a and b are the derivative of the function:</p>

<p><b>h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)</b> with respect to x is given by &minus;</p>

<p><b>h'(x) = af'(x) + bg'(x)</b></p>

<h3>Rule 2</h3>

<p>The <b>sum</b> and <b>subtraction</b> rules state that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p>(<b>f + g)' = f' + g'</b></p>

<p><b>(f - g)' = f' - g'</b></p>

<h3>Rule 3</h3>

<p>The <b>product</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p><b>(f.g)' = f'.g + g'.f</b></p>

<h3>Rule 4</h3>

<p>The <b>quotient</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>

<p><b>(f/g)' = (f'.g - g'.f)/g<sup>2</sup></b></p>

<h3>Rule 5</h3>

<p>The <b>polynomial</b> or elementary power rule states that, if <b>y = f(x) = x<sup>n</sup></b>, then <b>f' = n. x<sup>(n-1)</sup></b></p>

<p>A direct outcome of this rule is that the derivative of any constant is zero, i.e., if <b>y = k</b>, any constant, then</p>

<p><b>f' = 0</b></p>

<h3>Rule 6</h3>

<p>The <b>chain</b> rule states that, derivative of the function of a function <b>h(x) = f(g(x))</b> with respect to x is,</p>

<p><b>h'(x)= f'(g(x)).g'(x)</b></p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Computing Higher Order Derivatives</h2>

<p>To compute higher derivatives of a function f, we use the syntax <b>diff(f,n)</b>.</p>

<p>Let us compute the second derivative of the function y = f(x) = x .e<sup>-3x</sup></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, let us solve a problem. Given that a function <b>y = f(x) = 3 sin(x) + 7 cos(5x)</b>. We will have to find out whether the equation <b>f" + f = -5cos(2x)</b> holds true.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding the Maxima and Minima of a Curve</h2>

<p>If we are searching for the local maxima and minima for a graph, we are basically looking for the highest or lowest points on the graph of the function at a particular locality, or for a particular range of values of the symbolic variable.</p>

<p>For a function y = f(x) the points on the graph where the graph has zero slope are called <b>stationary points</b>. In other words stationary points are where f'(x) = 0.</p>

<p>To find the stationary points of a function we differentiate, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve the equation.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us find the stationary points of the function f(x) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 12x + 17</p>

<p>Take the following steps &minus;</p>

<p><b>First let us enter the function and plot its graph.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent code for the above example &minus;</p>

<p><b>Our aim is to find some local maxima and minima on the graph, so let us find the local maxima and minima for the interval [-2, 2] on the graph.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following plot &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent code for the above example &minus;</p>

<p><b>Next, let us compute the derivative.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Let us solve the derivative function, g, to get the values where it becomes zero.</b></p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>This agrees with our plot. So let us evaluate the function f at the critical points x = 1, -2.</b> We can substitute a value in a symbolic function by using the <b>subs</b> command.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Therefore, The minimum and maximum values on the function f(x) = 2x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 12x + 17, in the interval [-2,2] are 10 and 37.</p>

<h2>Solving Differential Equations</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>dsolve</b> command for solving differential equations symbolically.</p>

<p>The most basic form of the <b>dsolve</b> command for finding the solution to a single equation is</p>

<p>where <i>eqn</i> is a text string used to enter the equation.</p>

<p>It returns a symbolic solution with a set of arbitrary constants that MATLAB labels C1, C2, and so on. </p>

<p>You can also specify initial and boundary conditions for the problem, as comma-delimited list following the equation as &minus;</p>

<p>For the purpose of using dsolve command, <b>derivatives are indicated with a D</b>. For example, an equation like f'(t) = -2*f + cost(t) is entered as &minus;</p>

<p><b>'Df = -2*f + cos(t)'</b></p>

<p>Higher derivatives are indicated by following D by the order of the derivative.</p>

<p>For example the equation f"(x) + 2f'(x) = 5sin3x should be entered as &minus;</p>

<p><b>'D2y + 2Dy = 5*sin(3*x)'</b></p>

<p>Let us take up a simple example of a first order differential equation: y' = 5y.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let us take up another example of a second order differential equation as: y" - y = 0, y(0) = -1, y'(0) = 2.</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Integration</h1>

<p>Integration deals with two essentially different types of problems.</p>

<p>In the first type, derivative of a function is given and we want to find the function. Therefore, we basically reverse the process of differentiation. This reverse process is known as anti-differentiation, or finding the primitive function, or finding an <b>indefinite integral</b>.</p>

<p>The second type of problems involve adding up a very large number of very small quantities and then taking a limit as the size of the quantities approaches zero, while the number of terms tend to infinity. This process leads to the definition of the <b>definite integral</b>.</p>

<p>Definite integrals are used for finding area, volume, center of gravity, moment of inertia, work done by a force, and in numerous other applications.</p>

<h2>Finding Indefinite Integral Using MATLAB</h2>

<p>By definition, if the derivative of a function f(x) is f'(x), then we say that an indefinite integral of f'(x) with respect to x is f(x).  For example, since the derivative (with respect to x) of x<sup>2</sup> is 2x, we can say that an indefinite integral of 2x is x<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>In symbols &minus;</p>

<p><b>f'(x<sup>2</sup>) = 2x</b>, therefore,</p>

<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup>.</b></p>

<p>Indefinite integral is not unique, because derivative of x<sup>2</sup> + c, for any value of a constant c, will also be 2x.</p>

<p>This is expressed in symbols as &minus;</p>

<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup> + c</b>.</p>

<p>Where, c is called an 'arbitrary constant'.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides an <b>int</b> command for calculating integral of an expression. To derive an expression for the indefinite integral of a function, we write &minus;</p>

<p>For example, from our previous example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statement and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>In this example, let us find the integral of some commonly used expressions. Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>Note that the <b>pretty</b> function returns an expression in a more readable format.</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding Definite Integral Using MATLAB</h2>

<p>By definition, definite integral is basically the limit of a sum. We use definite integrals to find areas such as the area between a curve and the x-axis and the area between two curves. Definite integrals can also be used in other situations, where the quantity required can be expressed as the limit of a sum.</p>

<p>The <b>int</b> function can be used for definite integration by passing the limits over which you want to calculate the integral.</p>

<p>To calculate</p>

<p>we write,</p>

<p>For example, to calculate the value of <img src="/matlab/images/integration2.jpg" alt="Example" /> we write &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statement and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>An alternative solution can be given using quad() function provided by Octave as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Let us calculate the area enclosed between the x-axis, and the curve y = x<sup>3</sup>−2x+5 and the ordinates x = 1 and x = 2.</p>

<p>The required area is given by &minus;</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>An alternative solution can be given using quad() function provided by Octave as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Octave executes the code and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Find the area under the curve:  f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> cos(x) for −4 ≤ x ≤ 9.</p>

<p>Create a script file and write the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB plots the graph &minus;</p>

<p>The output is given below &minus;</p>

<p>Following is Octave equivalent of the above calculation &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Polynomials</h1>

<p>MATLAB represents polynomials as row vectors containing coefficients ordered by descending powers. For example, the equation P(x) = x<sup>4</sup> + 7x<sup>3</sup> - 5x + 9 could be represented as &minus;</p>

<p>p = [1 7 0  -5 9];</p>

<h2>Evaluating Polynomials</h2>

<p>The <b>polyval</b> function is used for evaluating a polynomial at a specified value. For example, to evaluate our previous polynomial <b>p</b>, at x = 4, type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB also provides the <b>polyvalm</b> function for evaluating a matrix polynomial. A matrix polynomial is a <b>polynomial</b> with matrices as variables.</p>

<p>For example, let us create a square matrix X and evaluate the polynomial p, at X &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding the Roots of Polynomials</h2>

<p>The <b>roots</b> function calculates the roots of a polynomial. For example, to calculate the roots of our polynomial p, type &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The function <b>poly</b> is an inverse of the roots function and returns to the polynomial coefficients. For example &minus;</p>

<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and returns the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Polynomial Curve Fitting</h2>

<p>The <b>polyfit</b> function finds the coefficients of a polynomial that fits a set of data in a least-squares sense. If x and y are two vectors containing the x and y data to be fitted to a n-degree polynomial, then we get the polynomial fitting the data by writing &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following result &minus;</p>

<p>And plots the following graph &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Transforms</h1>

<p>MATLAB provides command for working with transforms, such as the Laplace and Fourier transforms. Transforms are used in science and engineering as a tool for simplifying analysis and look at data from another angle.</p>

<p>For example, the Fourier transform allows us to convert a signal represented as a function of time to a function of frequency. Laplace transform allows us to convert a differential equation to an algebraic equation.</p>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>laplace</b>, <b>fourier</b> and <b>fft</b> commands to work with Laplace, Fourier and Fast Fourier transforms.</p>

<h2>The Laplace Transform</h2>

<p>The Laplace transform of a function of time f(t) is given by the following integral &minus;</p>

<p>Laplace transform is also denoted as transform of f(t) to F(s). You can see this transform or integration process converts f(t), a function of the symbolic variable t, into another function F(s), with another variable s.</p>

<p>Laplace transform turns differential equations into algebraic ones. To compute a Laplace transform of a function f(t), write &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In this example, we will compute the Laplace transform of some commonly used functions.</p>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The Inverse Laplace Transform</h2>

<p>MATLAB allows us to compute the inverse Laplace transform using the command <b>ilaplace</b>.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and display the result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The Fourier Transforms</h2>

<p>Fourier transforms commonly transforms a mathematical function of time, f(t), into a new function, sometimes denoted by  or F, whose argument is frequency with units of cycles/s (hertz) or radians per second. The new function is then known as the Fourier transform and/or the frequency spectrum of the function f.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB plots the following graph &minus;</p>

<p>The following result is displayed &minus;</p>

<p>Plotting the Fourier transform as &minus;</p>

<p>Gives the following graph &minus;</p>

<h2>Inverse Fourier Transforms</h2>

<p>MATLAB provides the <b>ifourier</b> command for computing the inverse Fourier transform of a function. For example,</p>

<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and display the result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - GNU Octave Tutorial</h1>

<p>GNU Octave is a high-level programming language like MATLAB and it is mostly compatible with MATLAB. It is also used for numerical computations.</p>

<p>Octave has the following common features with MATLAB &minus;</p>

<p>GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<h2>MATLAB vs Octave</h2>

<p>Most MATLAB programs run in Octave, but some of the Octave programs may not run in MATLAB because, Octave allows some syntax that MATLAB does not.</p>

<p>For example, MATLAB supports single quotes only, but Octave supports both single and double quotes for defining strings. If you are looking for a tutorial on Octave, then  kindly go through this tutorial from beginning which covers both MATLAB as well as Octave.</p>

<h3>Compatible Examples</h3>

<p>Almost all the examples covered in this tutorial are compatible with MATLAB as well as Octave. Let's try following example in MATLAB and Octave which produces same result without any syntax changes &minus;</p>

<p>This example creates a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup>. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>

<h3>Non-compatible Examples</h3>

<p>Though all the core functionality of MATLAB is available in Octave, there are some functionality for example, Differential &amp; Integration Calculus, which does not match exactly in both the languages. This tutorial has tried to give both type of examples where they differed in their syntax.</p>

<p>Consider following example where MATLAB and Octave make use of different functions to get the area of a curve: f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> cos(x) for −4 ≤ x ≤ 9. Following is MATLAB version of the code &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the file, MATLAB plots the graph &minus;</p>

<p>The following result is displayed</p>

<p>But to give area of the same curve in Octave, you will have to make use of <b>symbolic</b> package as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Simulink</h1>

<p>Simulink is a simulation and model-based design environment for dynamic and embedded systems, integrated with MATLAB. Simulink, also developed by MathWorks, is a data flow graphical programming language tool for modelling, simulating and analyzing multi-domain dynamic systems. It is basically a graphical block diagramming tool with customizable set of block libraries.</p>

<p>It allows you to incorporate MATLAB algorithms into models as well as export the simulation results into MATLAB for further analysis.</p>

<p>Simulink supports &minus;</p>

<p>There are several other add-on products provided by MathWorks and third-party hardware and software products that are available for use with Simulink.</p>

<p>The following list gives brief description of some of them &minus;</p>

<p><b>Stateflow</b> allows developing state machines and flow charts.</p>

<p><b>Simulink Coder</b> allows the generation of C source code for real-time implementation of systems automatically.</p>

<p><b>xPC Target</b> together with <b>x86-based real-time systems</b> provide an environment to simulate and test Simulink and Stateflow models in real-time on the physical system.</p>

<p><b>Embedded Coder</b> supports specific embedded targets.</p>

<p><b>HDL Coder</b> allows to automatically generate synthesizable VHDL and Verilog.</p>

<p><b>SimEvents</b> provides a library of graphical building blocks for modelling queuing systems.</p>

<p>Simulink is capable of systematic verification and validation of models through modelling style checking, requirements traceability and model coverage analysis.</p>

<p>Simulink Design Verifier allows you to identify design errors and to generate test case scenarios for model checking.</p>

<h2>Using Simulink</h2>

<p>To open Simulink, type in the MATLAB work space &minus;</p>

<p>Simulink opens with the <b>Library Browser</b>. The Library Browser is used for building simulation models.</p>

<p>On the left side window pane, you will find several libraries categorized on the basis of various systems, clicking on each one will display the design blocks on the right window pane.</p>

<h2>Building Models</h2>

<p>To create a new model, click the <b>New</b> button on the Library Browser's toolbar. This opens a new untitled model window.</p>

<p>A Simulink model is a block diagram.</p>

<p>Model elements are added by selecting the appropriate elements from the Library Browser and dragging them into the Model window.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can copy the model elements and paste them into the model window.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Drag and drop items from the Simulink library to make your project.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this example, two blocks will be used for the simulation - A <b>Source</b> (a signal) and a <b>Sink</b> (a scope). A signal generator (the source) generates an analog signal, which will then be graphically visualized by the scope(the sink).</p>

<p>Begin by dragging the required blocks from the library to the project window. Then, connect the blocks together which can be done by dragging connectors from connection points on one block to those of another.</p>

<p>Let us drag a 'Sine Wave' block into the model.</p>

<p>Select 'Sinks' from the library and drag a 'Scope' block into the model.</p>

<p>Drag a signal line from the output of the Sine Wave block to the input of the Scope block.</p>

<p>Run the simulation by pressing the '<b>Run</b>' button, keeping all parameters default (you can change them from the Simulation menu)</p>

<p>You should get the below graph from the scope.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Variables</h1>
<p>In MATLAB environment, every variable is an array or matrix.</p>
<p>You can assign variables in a simple way. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

x = 3	       % defining x and initializing it with a value
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 3
</pre>
<p>It creates a 1-by-1 matrix named <i>x</i> and stores the value 3 in its element. Let us check another example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

x = sqrt(16) 	% defining x and initializing it with an expression
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 4
</pre>
<p>Please note that &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Once a variable is entered into the system, you can refer to it later.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables must have values before they are used.</p></li>
<li><p>When an expression returns a result that is not assigned to any variable, the system assigns it to a variable named ans, which can be used later.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

sqrt(78)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  8.8318
</pre>
<p>You can use this variable <b>ans</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

sqrt(78);
9876/ans
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  1118.2
</pre>
<p>Let's look at another example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = 7 * 8;
y = x * 7.89
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
y =  441.84
</pre>
<h2>Multiple Assignments</h2>
<p>You can have multiple assignments on the same line. For example,</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
clear x     % it will delete x, won't display anything
clear	      % it will delete all variables in the workspace
            %  peacefully and unobtrusively 
</pre>
<h2>Long Assignments</h2>
<p>Long assignments can be extended to another line by using an ellipses (...). For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
initial_velocity = 0;
acceleration = 9.8;
time = 20;
final_velocity = initial_velocity + acceleration * time
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
final_velocity = 196
</pre>
<h2>The format Command</h2>
<p>By default, MATLAB displays numbers with four decimal place values. This is known as <b>short format</b>.</p>
<p>However, if you want more precision, you need to use the <b>format</b> command.</p>
<p>The <b>format long</b> command displays 16 digits after decimal.</p>
<p>For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format long
x = 7 + 10/3 + 5 ^ 1.2
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result&minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 17.2319816406394
</pre>
<p>Another example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format short
x = 7 + 10/3 + 5 ^ 1.2
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 17.232
</pre>
<p>The <b>format bank</b> command rounds numbers to two decimal places. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format bank
daily_wage = 177.45;
weekly_wage = daily_wage * 6
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
weekly_wage = 1064.70
</pre>
<p>MATLAB displays large numbers using exponential notation.</p>
<p>The <b>format short e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format short e
4.678 * 4.9
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans = 2.2922e+01
</pre>
<p>The <b>format long e</b> command allows displaying in exponential form with four decimal places plus the exponent. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format long e
x = pi
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
x = 3.141592653589793e+00
</pre>
<p>The <b>format rat</b> command gives the closest rational expression resulting from a calculation. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
format rat
4.678 * 4.9
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

</pre>
<h2>Creating Vectors</h2>
<p>A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Row vectors</li>
<li>Column vectors</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Row vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

r = [7 8 9 10 11]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
r =

    7    8    9   10   11 
</pre>
<p>Another example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
r = [7 8 9 10 11];

<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>
<p>In MATLAB, a matrix is created by entering each row as a sequence of space or comma separated elements, and end of a row is demarcated by a semicolon. For example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix as:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

m = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - M-Files</h1>
<p>So far, we have used MATLAB environment as a calculator. However, MATLAB is also a powerful programming language, as well as an interactive computational environment.</p>
<p>In previous chapters, you have learned how to enter commands from the MATLAB command prompt. MATLAB also allows you to write series of commands into a file and execute the file as complete unit, like writing a function and calling it.</p>
<h2>The M Files</h2>
<p>MATLAB allows writing two kinds of program files &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Scripts</b> &minus; script files are program files with <b>.m extension</b>. In these files, you write series of commands, which you want to execute together. Scripts do not accept inputs and do not return any outputs. They operate on data in the workspace.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Functions</b> &minus; functions files are also program files with <b>.m extension</b>. Functions can accept inputs and return outputs. Internal variables are local to the function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the MATLAB editor or any other text editor to create your <b>.m</b>files. In this section, we will discuss the script files. A script file contains multiple sequential lines of MATLAB commands and function calls. You can run a script by typing its name at the command line.</p>
<h2>Creating and Running Script File</h2>
<p>To create scripts files, you need to use a text editor. You can open the MATLAB editor in two ways:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Using the command prompt</li>
<li>Using the IDE</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the command prompt, type <b>edit</b> in the command prompt. This will open the editor. You can directly type <b>edit</b> and then the filename (with .m extension)</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
edit 
Or
edit &lt;filename&gt;
</pre>
<p>The above command will create the file in default MATLAB directory. If you want to store all program files in a specific folder, then you will have to provide the entire path.</p>
<p>Let us create a folder named progs. Type the following commands at the command prompt (>>):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
mkdir progs    % create directory progs under default directory
chdir progs    % changing the current directory to progs
edit  prog1.m  % creating an m file named prog1.m
</pre>
<p>If you are creating the file for first time, MATLAB prompts you to confirm it. Click Yes.</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/m_files1.jpg" alt="Creating a Script File" />
<p>Alternatively, if you are using the IDE, choose NEW -&gt; Script. This also opens the editor and creates a file named Untitled. You can name and save the file after typing the code.</p>
<p>Type the following code in the editor &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
NoOfStudents = 6000;
TeachingStaff = 150;
NonTeachingStaff = 20;
Total = NoOfStudents + TeachingStaff ...
   + NonTeachingStaff;
disp(Total);
</pre>
<p>After creating and saving the file, you can run it in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Clicking the <b>Run</b> button on the editor window or</li>
<li>Just typing the filename (without extension) in the command prompt:
&gt;&gt; prog1</li>
</ul>
<p>The command window prompt displays the result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
6170
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file, and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = 5; b = 7;
c = a + b
d = c + sin(b)
e = 5 * d
f = exp(-d)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
c =  12
d =  12.657
e =  63.285
f =    3.1852e-06
</pre>
<h1>MATLAB - Data Types</h1>
<p>MATLAB does not require any type declaration or dimension statements. Whenever MATLAB encounters a new variable name, it creates the variable and allocates appropriate memory space.</p>
<p>If the variable already exists, then MATLAB replaces the original content with new content and allocates new storage space, where necessary.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Total = 42
</pre>
<p>The above statement creates a 1-by-1 matrix named 'Total' and stores the value 42 in it.</p>
<h2>Data Types Available in MATLAB</h2>
<p>MATLAB provides 15 fundamental data types. Every data type stores data that is in the form of a matrix or array. The size of this matrix or array is a minimum of 0-by-0 and this can grow up to a matrix or array of any size.</p>
<p>The following table shows the most commonly used data types in MATLAB &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Operators</h1>
<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. MATLAB is designed to operate primarily on whole matrices and arrays. Therefore, operators in MATLAB work both on scalar and non-scalar data. MATLAB allows the following types of elementary operations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Relational Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operations</li>
<li>Set Operations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>
<p>MATLAB allows two different types of arithmetic operations &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Matrix arithmetic operations</li>
<li>Array arithmetic operations</li>
</ul>
<p>Matrix arithmetic operations are same as defined in linear algebra. Array operations are executed element by element, both on one-dimensional and multidimensional array.</p>
<p>The matrix operators and array operators are differentiated by the period (.) symbol. However, as the addition and subtraction operation is same for matrices and arrays, the operator is same for both cases. The following table gives brief description of the operators &minus;</p>
<p><a href="/matlab/matlab_arithmetic_operators.htm" title="Arithmetic Operators in MATLAB">Show Examples</a></p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:15%;">Operator</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>+</b></td>
<td>Addition or unary plus. A+B adds the values stored in variables A and B. A and B must have the same size, unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be added to a matrix of any size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>-</b></td>
<td>Subtraction or unary minus. A-B subtracts the value of B from A. A and B must have the same size, unless one is a scalar. A scalar can be subtracted from a matrix of any size.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>*</b></td>
<td><p>Matrix multiplication. C = A*B is the linear algebraic product of the matrices A and B. More precisely,</p>
<p><img src="/matlab/images/matlab_arithmetic_operators1.jpg" alt="Matrix Multiplication"></p>
<p>For non-scalar A and B, the number of columns of A must be equal to the number of rows of B. A scalar can multiply a matrix of any size.</p></td>

<tr>
<td><b>.*</b></td>
<td>Array multiplication. A.*B is the element-by-element product of the arrays A and B. A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.</td>

<td><b>./</b></td>
<td>Array right division. A./B is the matrix with elements A(i,j)/B(i,j). A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>\</b></td>
<td>Backslash or matrix left division. If A is a square matrix, A\B is roughly the same as inv(A)*B, except it is computed in a different way. If A is an n-by-n matrix and B is a column vector with n components, or a matrix with several such columns, then X = A\B is the solution to the equation <i>AX = B</i>. A warning message is displayed if A is badly scaled or nearly singular.</td>

<td><b>.\</b></td>
<td>Array left division. A.\B is the matrix with elements B(i,j)/A(i,j). A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>^</b></td>
<td>Matrix power. X^p is X to the power p, if p is a scalar. If p is an integer, the power is computed by repeated squaring. If the integer is negative, X is inverted first. For other values of p, the calculation involves eigenvalues and eigenvectors, such that if [V,D] = eig(X), then X^p = V*D.^p/V.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>.^</b></td>
<td>Array power. A.^B is the matrix with elements A(i,j) to the B(i,j) power. A and B must have the same size, unless one of them is a scalar.</td>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>
<p>Relational operators can also work on both scalar and non-scalar data. Relational operators for arrays perform element-by-element comparisons between two arrays and return a logical array of the same size, with elements set to logical 1 (true) where the relation is true and elements set to logical 0 (false) where it is not.</p>
<p>The following table shows the relational operators available in MATLAB:</p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>
<p>MATLAB offers two types of logical operators and functions:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Element-wise &minus; These operators operate on corresponding elements of logical arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>Short-circuit &minus; These operators operate on scalar and, logical expressions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Element-wise logical operators operate element-by-element on logical arrays. The symbols &, |, and ~ are the logical array operators AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
<p>Short-circuit logical operators allow short-circuiting on logical operations. The symbols && and || are the logical short-circuit operators AND and OR.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Decision Making</h1>
<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer should specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.</p>
<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Loop Types</h1>
<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Vectors</h1>
<p>A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. MATLAB allows creating two types of vectors &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Row vectors</li>
<li>Column vectors</li>
</ul>
<h2>Row Vectors</h2>
<p><b>Row vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using space or comma to delimit the elements.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

r = [7 8 9 10 11]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
r =

    7    8    9   10   11 
</pre>
<h2>Column Vectors</h2>
<p><b>Column vectors</b> are created by enclosing the set of elements in square brackets, using semicolon to delimit the elements.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

c = [7;  8;  9;  10; 11]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
c =
       7       
       8       
       9       
      10       
      11  
 
</pre>
<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Vector</h2>
<p>You can reference one or more of the elements of a vector in several ways. The i<sup>th</sup> component of a vector v is referred as v(i). For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

v = [ 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6];	% creating a column vector of 6 elements
v(3)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  3
</pre>
<p>When you reference a vector with a colon, such as v(:), all the components of the vector are listed.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

v = [ 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6];	% creating a column vector of 6 elements
v(:)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
     6
</pre>
<p>MATLAB allows you to select a range of elements from a vector.</p>
<p>For example, let us create a row vector <i>rv</i> of 9 elements, then we will reference the elements 3 to 7 by writing <i><b>rv(3:7)</b></i> and create a new vector named <i>sub_rv</i>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint  notranslate tryit">
rv = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9];
sub_rv = rv(3:7)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
sub_rv =

<h1>MATLAB - Matrix</h1>
<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional array of numbers.</p>
<p>In MATLAB, you create a matrix by entering elements in each row as comma or space delimited numbers and using semicolons to mark the end of each row.</p>
<p>For example, let us create a 4-by-5 matrix <i>a</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a =
     1     2     3     4     5
     2     3     4     5     6
     3     4     5     6     7
     4     5     6     7     8
</pre>
<h2>Referencing the Elements of a Matrix</h2>
<p>To reference an element in the m<sup>th</sup> row and n<sup>th</sup> column, of a matrix <i>mx</i>, we write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
mx(m, n);
</pre>
<p>For example, to refer to the element in the 2<sup>nd</sup> row and 5<sup>th</sup> column, of the matrix <i>a</i>, as created in the last section, we type &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(2,5)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  6
</pre>
<p>To reference all the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> column we type A(:,m).</p>
<p>Let us create a column vector v, from the elements of the 4<sup>th</sup> row of the matrix a:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
v = a(:,4)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
v =
     4
     5
     6
     7
</pre>
<p>You can also select the elements in the m<sup>th</sup> through n<sup>th</sup> columns, for this we write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
a(:,m:n)
</pre>
<p>Let us create a smaller matrix taking the elements from the second and third columns &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(:, 2:3)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
     2     3
     3     4
     4     5
     5     6
</pre>
<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(:, 2:3)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
     2     3
     3     4
     4     5
     5     6
</pre>
<p>In the same way, you can create a sub-matrix taking a sub-part of a matrix.</p>
<p>For example, let us create a sub-matrix <i>sa</i> taking the inner subpart of a:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
3     4     5     
4     5     6     
</pre>
<p>To do this, write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
sa = a(2:3,2:4)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
sa =
     3     4     5
     4     5     6
</pre>
<h2>Deleting a Row or a Column in a Matrix</h2>
<p>You can delete an entire row or column of a matrix by assigning an empty set of square braces [] to that row or column. Basically, [] denotes an empty array.</p>
<p>For example, let us delete the fourth row of a &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a( 4 , : ) = []
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a =
     1     2     3     4     5
     2     3     4     5     6
     3     4     5     6     7
</pre>
<p>Next, let us delete the fifth column of a &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 4 5; 2 3 4 5 6; 3 4 5 6 7; 4 5 6 7 8];
a(: , 5)=[]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a =
     1     2     3     4
     2     3     4     5
     3     4     5     6
     4     5     6     7
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In this example, let us create a 3-by-3 matrix m, then we will copy the second and third rows of this matrix twice to create a 4-by-3 matrix.</p>
<p>Create a script file with the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [ 1 2 3 ; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
new_mat = a([2,3,2,3],:)

<h2>Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
<p>An array having more than two dimensions is called a multidimensional array in MATLAB. Multidimensional arrays in MATLAB are an extension of the normal two-dimensional matrix.</p>
<p>Generally to generate a multidimensional array, we first create a two-dimensional array and extend it.</p>
<p>For example, let's create a two-dimensional array a.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

a = [7 9 5; 6 1 9; 4 3 2]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a =
     7     9     5
     6     1     9
     4     3     2
</pre>
<p>The array <i>a</i> is a 3-by-3 array; we can add a third dimension to <i>a</i>, by providing the values like &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

a(:, :, 2)= [ 1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a =

ans(:,:,1) =

   0   0   0
   0   0   0
   0   0   0

ans(:,:,2) =

   1   2   3
   4   5   6
   7   8   9
</pre>
<p>We can also create multidimensional arrays using the ones(), zeros() or the rand() functions.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

b = rand(4,3,2)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
b(:,:,1) =
    0.0344    0.7952    0.6463
    0.4387    0.1869    0.7094
    0.3816    0.4898    0.7547
    0.7655    0.4456    0.2760

b(:,:,2) =
    0.6797    0.4984    0.2238
    0.6551    0.9597    0.7513
    0.1626    0.3404    0.2551
    0.1190    0.5853    0.5060
</pre>
<p>We can also use the <b>cat()</b> function to build multidimensional arrays. It concatenates a list of arrays along a specified dimension &minus;</p>
<p>Syntax for the cat() function is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
B = cat(dim, A1, A2...)
</pre>
<p>Where,</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li><p><i>B</i> is the new array created</p></li>
<li><p><i>A1</i>, <i>A2</i>, ... are the arrays to be concatenated</p></li>
<li><p><i>dim</i> is the dimension along which to concatenate the arrays</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a = [9 8 7; 6 5 4; 3 2 1];
b = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];
c = cat(3, a, b, [ 2 3 1; 4 7 8; 3 9 0])

<h1>MATLAB - Strings</h1>
<p>Creating a character string is quite simple in MATLAB. In fact, we have used it many times. For example, you type the following in the command prompt &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

my_string = 'Tutorial's Point'
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
my_string = Tutorial's Point
</pre>
<p>MATLAB considers all variables as arrays, and strings are considered as character arrays. Let us use the <b>whos</b> command to check the variable created above &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

whos
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name           Size            Bytes  Class    Attributes
my_string      1x16               32  char
</pre>
<p>Interestingly, you can use numeric conversion functions like <b>uint8</b> or <b>uint16</b> to convert the characters in the string to their numeric codes. The <b>char</b> function converts the integer vector back to characters &minus;</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
my_string = 'Tutorial''s Point';
str_ascii = uint8(my_string)        % 8-bit ascii values
str_back_to_char= char(str_ascii)  
str_16bit = uint16(my_string)       % 16-bit ascii values
str_back_to_char = char(str_16bit)  
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
str_ascii =

   84  117  116  111  114  105   97  108   39  115   32   80  111  105  110  116

str_back_to_char = Tutorial's Point
str_16bit =

   84  117  116  111  114  105   97  108   39  115   32   80  111  105  110  116

str_back_to_char = Tutorial's Point
</pre>
<h2>Rectangular Character Array</h2>
<p>The strings we have discussed so far are one-dimensional character arrays; however, we need to store more than that. We need to store more dimensional textual data in our program. This is achieved by creating rectangular character arrays.</p>
<p>Simplest way of creating a rectangular character array is by concatenating two or more one-dimensional character arrays, either vertically or horizontally as required.</p>
<p>You can combine strings vertically in either of the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator <b>[]</b> and separating each row with a semicolon (;). Please note that in this method each row must contain the same number of characters. For strings with different lengths, you should pad with space characters as needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <b>char</b> function. If the strings are of different lengths, char pads the shorter strings with trailing blanks so that each row has the same number of characters.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
doc_profile = ['Zara Ali                             '; ...
               'Sr. Surgeon                          '; ...
               'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center']
doc_profile = char('Zara Ali', 'Sr. Surgeon', ...
                   'RN Tagore Cardiology Research Center')
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
doc_profile =
Zara Ali                             
Sr. Surgeon                          
R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
doc_profile =
Zara Ali                            
Sr. Surgeon                         
RN Tagore Cardiology Research Center
</pre>
<p>You can combine strings horizontally in either of the following ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the MATLAB concatenation operator, <b>[]</b> and separating the input strings with a comma or a space. This method preserves any trailing spaces in the input arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the string concatenation function, <b>strcat</b>. This method removes trailing spaces in the inputs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
name =     'Zara Ali                             ';
position = 'Sr. Surgeon                          '; 
worksAt =  'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center';
profile = [name ', ' position ', ' worksAt]
profile = strcat(name, ', ', position, ', ', worksAt)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
profile = Zara Ali                             , Sr. Surgeon                          , R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
profile = Zara Ali,Sr. Surgeon,R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center
</pre>
<h2>Combining Strings into a Cell Array</h2>
<p>From our previous discussion, it is clear that combining strings with different lengths could be a pain as all strings in the array has to be of the same length. We have used blank spaces at the end of strings to equalize their length.</p>
<p>However, a more efficient way to combine the strings is to convert the resulting array into a cell array.</p>
<p>MATLAB cell array can hold different sizes and types of data in an array. Cell arrays provide a more flexible way to store strings of varying length.</p>
<p>The <b>cellstr</b> function converts a character array into a cell array of strings.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
name =     'Zara Ali                             ';
position = 'Sr. Surgeon                          '; 
worksAt =  'R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center';
profile = char(name, position, worksAt);
profile = cellstr(profile);
disp(profile)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
{                                                                               
  [1,1] = Zara Ali                                                              
  [2,1] = Sr. Surgeon                                                           
  [3,1] = R N Tagore Cardiology Research Center                                 
}

<h1>MATLAB - Functions</h1>
<p>A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. In MATLAB, functions are defined in separate files. The name of the file and of the function should be the same.</p>
<p>Functions operate on variables within their own workspace, which is also called the <b>local workspace</b>, separate from the workspace you access at the MATLAB command prompt which is called the <b>base workspace</b>.</p>
<p>Functions can accept more than one input arguments and may return more than one output arguments.</p>
<p>Syntax of a function statement is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
function [out1,out2, ..., outN] = myfun(in1,in2,in3, ..., inN)
</pre>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following function named <i>mymax</i> should be written in a file named <i>mymax.m</i>. It takes five numbers as argument and returns the maximum of the numbers.</p>
<p>Create a function file, named mymax.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="mymax">
function max = mymax(n1, n2, n3, n4, n5)
%This function calculates the maximum of the
% five numbers given as input
max =  n1;
if(n2 &gt; max)
    max = n2;
end
if(n3 &gt; max)
   max = n3;
end
if(n4 &gt; max)
    max = n4;
end
if(n5 &gt; max)
    max = n5;
end
</pre>
<p>The first line of a function starts with the keyword <b>function</b>. It gives the name of the function and order of arguments. In our example, the <i>mymax</i> function has five input arguments and one output argument.</p>
<p>The comment lines that come right after the function statement provide the help text. These lines are printed when you type &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" title="mymax">
help mymax
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This function calculates the maximum of the
 five numbers given as input
</pre>
<p>You can call the function as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" title="mymax">
mymax(34, 78, 89, 23, 11)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans = 89
</pre>
<h2>Anonymous Functions</h2>
<p>An anonymous function is like an inline function in traditional programming languages, defined within a single MATLAB statement. It consists of a single MATLAB expression and any number of input and output arguments.</p>
<p>You can define an anonymous function right at the MATLAB command line or within a function or script.</p>
<p>This way you can create simple functions without having to create a file for them.</p>
<p>The syntax for creating an anonymous function from an expression is</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
f = @(arglist)expression
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In this example, we will write an anonymous function named power, which will take two numbers as input and return first number raised to the power of the second number.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
power = @(x, n) x.^n;
result1 = power(7, 3)
result2 = power(49, 0.5)
result3 = power(10, -10)
result4 = power (4.5, 1.5)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
result1 =  343
result2 =  7
result3 =  1.0000e-10
result4 =  9.5459
</pre>
<h2>Primary and Sub-Functions</h2>
<p>Any function other than an anonymous function must be defined within a file. Each function file contains a required primary function that appears first and any number of optional sub-functions that comes after the primary function and used by it.</p>
<p>Primary functions can be called from outside of the file that defines them, either from command line or from other functions, but sub-functions cannot be called from command line or other functions, outside the function file.</p>
<p>Sub-functions are visible only to the primary function and other sub-functions within the function file that defines them.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us write a function named quadratic that would calculate the roots of a quadratic equation. The function would take three inputs, the quadratic co-efficient, the linear co-efficient and the constant term. It would return the roots.</p>
<p>The function file quadratic.m will contain the primary function <i>quadratic</i> and the sub-function <i>disc</i>, which calculates the discriminant.</p>
<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic.m</i> and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="quadratic">
function [x1,x2] = quadratic(a,b,c)
%this function returns the roots of 
% a quadratic equation.
% It takes 3 input arguments
% which are the co-efficients of x2, x and the 
%constant term
% It returns the roots
d = disc(a,b,c); 
x1 = (-b + d) / (2*a);
x2 = (-b - d) / (2*a);
end % end of quadratic

function dis = disc(a,b,c) 
%function calculates the discriminant
dis = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c);
end % end of sub-function
</pre>
<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="quadratic">

quadratic(2,4,-4)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans = 0.7321
</pre>
<h2>Nested Functions</h2>
<p>You can define functions within the body of another function. These are called nested functions. A nested function contains any or all of the components of any other function.</p>
<p>Nested functions are defined within the scope of another function and they share access to the containing function's workspace.</p>
<p>A nested function follows the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
function x = A(p1, p2)
...
B(p2)
   function y = B(p3)
   ...
   end
...
end
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us rewrite the function <i>quadratic</i>, from previous example, however, this time the disc function will be a nested function.</p>
<p>Create a function file <i>quadratic2.m </i>and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="nested">
function [x1,x2] = quadratic2(a,b,c)
function disc  % nested function
d = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c);
end % end of function disc
disc;
x1 = (-b + d) / (2*a);
x2 = (-b - d) / (2*a);
end % end of function quadratic2
</pre>
<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="nested">

quadratic2(2,4,-4)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  0.73205
</pre>
<h2>Private Functions</h2>
<p>A private function is a primary function that is visible only to a limited group of other functions. If you do not want to expose the implementation of a function(s), you can create them as private functions.</p>
<p>Private functions reside in <b>subfolders</b> with the special name <b>private</b>.</p>
<p>They are visible only to functions in the parent folder.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us rewrite the <i>quadratic</i> function. This time, however, the <i>disc</i> function calculating the discriminant, will be a private function.</p>
<p>Create a subfolder named private in working directory. Store the following function file <i>disc.m </i>in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="disc">
function dis = disc(a,b,c) 
%function calculates the discriminant
dis = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c);
end % end of sub-function
</pre>
<p>Create a function quadratic3.m in your working directory and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="quadratic3">
function [x1,x2] = quadratic3(a,b,c)
%this function returns the roots of 
% a quadratic equation.
% It takes 3 input arguments
% which are the co-efficient of x2, x and the 
%constant term
% It returns the roots
d = disc(a,b,c); 
x1 = (-b + d) / (2*a);
x2 = (-b - d) / (2*a);
end % end of quadratic3
</pre>
<p>You can call the above function from command prompt as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="disc, quadratic3">
quadratic3(2,4,-4)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =  0.73205
</pre>
<h2>Global Variables</h2>
<p>Global variables can be shared by more than one function. For this, you need to declare the variable as global in all the functions.</p>
<p>If you want to access that variable from the base workspace, then declare the variable at the command line.</p>
<p>The global declaration must occur before the variable is actually used in a function. It is a good practice to use capital letters for the names of global variables to distinguish them from other variables.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us create a function file named average.m and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="average">
function avg = average(nums)
global TOTAL
avg = sum(nums)/TOTAL;
end
</pre>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="average">
global TOTAL;
TOTAL = 10;
n = [34, 45, 25, 45, 33, 19, 40, 34, 38, 42];
av = average(n)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it will display the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
av =  35.500
</pre>
<h1>MATLAB - Data Import</h1>

<h1>MATLAB - Data Output</h1>
<p>Data export (or output) in MATLAB means to write into files. MATLAB allows you to use your data in another application that reads ASCII files. For this, MATLAB provides several data export options.</p>
<p>You can create the following type of files:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Rectangular, delimited ASCII data file from an array.</p></li>
<li><p>Diary (or log) file of keystrokes and the resulting text output.</p></li>
<li><p>Specialized ASCII file using low-level functions such as fprintf.</p></li>
<li><p>MEX-file to access your C/C++ or Fortran routine that writes to a particular text file format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from this, you can also export data to spreadsheets.</p>
<p>There are two ways to export a numeric array as a delimited ASCII data file &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Using the <b>save</b> function and specifying the <b>-ascii</b> qualifier</p></li>
<li><p>Using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Syntax for using the save function is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
save my_data.out num_array -ascii
</pre>
<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <b>&minus;ascii</b> is the specifier.</p>
<p>Syntax for using the <b>dlmwrite</b> function is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
dlmwrite('my_data.out', num_array, 'dlm_char')
</pre>
<p>where, <i>my_data.out</i> is the delimited ASCII data file created, <i>num_array</i> is a numeric array and  <i>dlm_char</i> is the delimiter character.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example demonstrates the concept. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
num_array = [ 1 2 3 4 ; 4 5 6 7; 7 8 9 0];
save array_data1.out num_array -ascii;
type array_data1.out
dlmwrite('array_data2.out', num_array, ' ');
type array_data2.out
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
   1.0000000e+00   2.0000000e+00   3.0000000e+00   4.0000000e+00
   4.0000000e+00   5.0000000e+00   6.0000000e+00   7.0000000e+00
   7.0000000e+00   8.0000000e+00   9.0000000e+00   0.0000000e+00

1 2 3 4
4 5 6 7
7 8 9 0
</pre>
<p>Please note that the save -ascii command and the dlmwrite function does not work with cell arrays as input. To create a delimited ASCII file from the contents of a cell array, you can</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Either, convert the cell array to a matrix using the <b>cell2mat</b> function</p></li>
<li><p>Or export the cell array using low-level file I/O functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you use the <b>save</b> function to write a character array to an ASCII file, it writes the ASCII equivalent of the characters to the file.</p>
<p>For example, let us write the word 'hello' to a file &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
h = 'hello';
save textdata.out h -ascii
type textdata.out
</pre>
<p>MATLAB executes the above statements and displays the following result. which is the characters of the string 'hello' in 8-digit ASCII format.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
1.0400000e+02   1.0100000e+02   1.0800000e+02   1.0800000e+02   1.1100000e+02
</pre>
<h2>Writing to Diary Files</h2>
<p>Diary files are activity logs of your MATLAB session. The diary function creates an exact copy of your session in a disk file, excluding graphics.</p>
<p>To turn on the diary function, type &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
diary
</pre>
<p> Optionally, you can give the name of the log file, say &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
diary logdata.out
</pre>
<p>To turn off the diary function &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
diary off
</pre>
<p>You can open the diary file in a text editor.</p>
<h2>Exporting Data to Text Data Files with Low-Level I/O</h2>
<p>So far, we have exported numeric arrays. However, you may need to create other text files, including combinations of numeric and character data, nonrectangular output files, or files with non-ASCII encoding schemes. For these purposes, MATLAB provides the low-level <b>fprintf</b> function.</p>
<p>As in low-level I/O file activities, before exporting, you need to open or create a file with the <b>fopen</b> function and get the file identifier. By default, fopen opens a file for read-only access. You should specify the permission to write or append, such as 'w' or 'a'.</p>
<p>After processing the file, you need to close it with <b>fclose(fid)</b> function.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
% create a matrix y, with two rows
x = 0:10:100;
y = [x; log(x)];
 
% open a file for writing
fid = fopen('logtable.txt', 'w');
 
% Table Header
fprintf(fid, 'Log     Function\n\n');
 
% print values in column order
% two values appear on each row of the file
fprintf(fid, '%f    %f\n', y);
fclose(fid);
% display the file created
type logtable.txt
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>MATLAB - Plotting</h1>
<p>To plot the graph of a function, you need to take the following steps &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Define <b>x</b>, by specifying the <b>range of values</b> for the variable <b>x</b>, for which the function is to be plotted</p></li>
<li><p>Define the function, <b>y = f(x)</b></p></li>
<li><p>Call the <b>plot</b> command, as <b>plot(x, y)</b></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following example would demonstrate the concept. Let us plot the simple function <b>y = x</b> for the range of values for x from 0 to 100, with an increment of 5.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [0:5:100];
y = x;
plot(x, y)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/plotting1.jpg" alt="Plotting y = x" />
<p>Let us take one more example to plot the function y = x<sup>2</sup>. In this example, we will draw two graphs with the same function, but in second time, we will reduce the value of increment. Please note that as we decrease the increment, the graph becomes smoother.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10];
x = [-100:20:100];
y = x.^2;
plot(x, y)
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following plot &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/plotting2.jpg" alt="Plotting y = x^2" />
<p>Change the code file a little, reduce the increment to 5 &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [-100:5:100];
y = x.^2;
plot(x, y)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB draws a smoother graph &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/plotting3.jpg" alt="Plotting y = x^2 with less increment"/>
<h2>Adding Title, Labels, Grid Lines and Scaling on the Graph</h2>
<p>MATLAB allows you to add title, labels along the x-axis and y-axis, grid lines and also to adjust the axes to spruce up the graph.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>xlabel</b> and <b>ylabel</b> commands generate labels along x-axis and y-axis.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>title</b> command allows you to put a title on the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>grid on</b> command allows you to put the grid lines on the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>axis equal</b> command allows generating the plot with the same scale factors and the spaces on both axes.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>axis square</b> command generates a square plot.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [0:0.01:10];
y = sin(x);
plot(x, y), xlabel('x'), ylabel('Sin(x)'), title('Sin(x) Graph'),
grid on, axis equal
</pre>
<p>MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/plotting4.jpg" alt="Sprucing up our graphs" />
<h2>Drawing Multiple Functions on the Same Graph</h2>
<p>You can draw multiple graphs on the same plot. The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [0 : 0.01: 10];
y = sin(x);
g = cos(x);
plot(x, y, x, g, '.-'), legend('Sin(x)', 'Cos(x)')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us draw the graph of two polynomials</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>f(x) = 3x<sup>4</sup> + 2x<sup>3</sup>+ 7x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 9 and</p></li>
<li><p>g(x) = 5x<sup>3</sup> + 9x + 2</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [-10 : 0.01: 10];
y = 3*x.^4 + 2 * x.^3 + 7 * x.^2 + 2 * x + 9;
g = 5 * x.^3 + 9 * x + 2;

</pre>

<h2>Setting Axis Scales</h2>
<p>The <b>axis</b> command allows you to set the axis scales. You can provide minimum and maximum values for x and y axes using the axis command in the following way:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
axis ( [xmin xmax ymin ymax] )
</pre>
<p>The following example shows this &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [0 : 0.01: 10];
y = exp(-x).* sin(2*x + 3);
plot(x, y), axis([0 10 -1 1])
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/plotting7.jpg" alt="Setting Axis Scales" />
<h2>Generating Sub-Plots</h2>
<p>When you create an array of plots in the same figure, each of these plots is called a subplot. The <b>subplot</b> command is used for creating subplots.</p> 
<p>Syntax for the command is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
subplot(m, n, p)
</pre>
<p>where, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the number of rows and columns of the plot array and <i>p</i> specifies where to put a particular plot.</p>
<p>Each plot created with the subplot command can have its own characteristics. Following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us generate two plots &minus;</p>
<p>y = e<sup>−1.5x</sup>sin(10x)</p>
<p>y = e<sup>−2x</sup>sin(10x)</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [0:0.01:5];
y = exp(-1.5*x).*sin(10*x);
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(x,y), xlabel('x'),ylabel('exp(–1.5x)*sin(10x)'),axis([0 5 -1 1])
y = exp(-2*x).*sin(10*x);
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(x,y),xlabel('x'),ylabel('exp(–2x)*sin(10x)'),axis([0 5 -1 1])
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB generates the following graph &minus;</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Graphics</h1>
<p>This chapter will continue exploring the plotting and graphics capabilities of MATLAB. We will discuss &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Drawing bar charts</li>
<li>Drawing contours</li>
<li>Three dimensional plots</li>
</ul>
<h2>Drawing Bar Charts</h2>
<p>The <b>bar</b> command draws a two dimensional bar chart. Let us take up an example to demonstrate the idea.</p>
<h3>Example</h3> 
<p>Let us have an imaginary classroom with 10 students. We know the percent of marks obtained by these students are 75, 58, 90, 87, 50, 85, 92, 75, 60 and 95. We will draw the bar chart for this data.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
x = [1:10];
y = [75, 58, 90, 87, 50, 85, 92, 75, 60, 95];
bar(x,y), xlabel('Student'),ylabel('Score'),
title('First Sem:')
print -deps graph.eps
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following bar chart &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/graphics1.jpg" alt="Drawing Bar Charts" />
<h2>Drawing Contours</h2>
<p>A contour line of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value. Contour lines are used for creating contour maps by joining points of equal elevation above a given level, such as mean sea level.</p>
<p>MATLAB provides a <b>contour</b> function for drawing contour maps.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us generate a contour map that shows the contour lines for a given function g = f(x, y). This function has two variables. So, we will have to generate two independent variables, i.e., two data sets x and y. This is done by calling the <b>meshgrid</b> command.</p>
<p>The <b>meshgrid</b> command is used for generating a matrix of elements that give the range over x and y along with the specification of increment in each case.</p>
<p>Let us plot our function g = f(x, y), where −5 ≤ x ≤ 5, −3 ≤ y ≤ 3. Let us take an increment of 0.1 for both the values. The variables are set as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
[x,y] = meshgrid(–5:0.1:5, –3:0.1:3);
</pre>
<p>Lastly, we need to assign the function. Let our function be: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
[x,y] = meshgrid(-5:0.1:5,-3:0.1:3); %independent variables
g = x.^2 + y.^2;                     % our function
contour(x,y,g)                       % call the contour function
print -deps graph.eps
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/graphics2.jpg" alt="Contour Map in Matlab" />
<p>Let us modify the code a little to spruce up the map </p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
[x,y] = meshgrid(-5:0.1:5,-3:0.1:3); %independent variables
g = x.^2 + y.^2;                     % our function
[C, h] = contour(x,y,g);             % call the contour function
set(h,'ShowText','on','TextStep',get(h,'LevelStep')*2)
print -deps graph.eps
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following contour map &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/graphics3.jpg" alt="A good looking Contour Map" />
<h2>Three Dimensional Plots</h2>
<p>Three-dimensional plots basically display a surface defined by a function in two variables, g = f (x,y).</p>
<p>As before, to define g, we first create a set of (x,y) points over the domain of the function using the <b>meshgrid</b> command. Next, we assign the function itself. Finally, we use the <b>surf</b> command to create a surface plot.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the concept &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us create a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup></p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
[x,y] = meshgrid(-2:.2:2);
g = x .* exp(-x.^2 - y.^2);
surf(x, y, g)
print -deps graph.eps
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/graphics4.jpg" alt="3-D Map in Matlab" />
<p>You can also use the <b>mesh</b> command to generate a three-dimensional surface. However, the <b>surf</b> command displays both the connecting lines and the faces of the surface in color, whereas, the <b>mesh</b> command creates a wireframe surface with colored lines connecting the defining points.</p>
<h1>MATLAB - Algebra</h1>
<p>So far, we have seen that all the examples work in MATLAB as well as its  GNU, alternatively called Octave. But for solving basic algebraic equations, both MATLAB and Octave are little different, so we will try to cover  MATLAB and Octave in separate sections.</p>
<p>We will also discuss factorizing and simplification of algebraic expressions.</p>
<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in MATLAB</h2>
<p>The <b>solve</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations. In its simplest form, the solve function takes the equation enclosed in quotes as an argument.</p>
<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
solve('x-5=0')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
 5
</pre>
<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

y = solve('x-5 = 0')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
y =
 5
</pre>
<p>You may even not include the right hand side of the equation &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

solve('x-5')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
 5
</pre>
<p>If the equation involves multiple symbols, then MATLAB by default assumes that you are solving for x, however, the solve function has another form &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
solve(equation, variable)
</pre>
<p>where, you can also mention the variable.</p>
<p>For example, let us solve the equation v – u – 3t<sup>2</sup> = 0, for v. In this case, we should write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
solve('v-u-3*t^2=0', 'v')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
 3*t^2 + u
</pre>
<h2>Solving Basic Algebraic Equations in Octave</h2>
<p>The <b>roots</b> function is used for solving algebraic equations in Octave and you can write above examples as follows:</p>
<p>For example, let us solve for x in the equation x-5 = 0</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

roots([1, -5])
</pre>
<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans = 5
</pre>
<p>You can also call the solve function as &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

y = roots([1, -5])
</pre>
<p>Octave will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
y = 5
</pre>
<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in MATLAB</h2>
<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. It is often used to solve quadratic equations. The function returns the roots of the equation in an array.</p>
<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
eq = 'x^2 -7*x + 12 = 0';
s = solve(eq);
disp('The first root is: '), disp(s(1));
disp('The second root is: '), disp(s(2));
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The first root is: 
   3
The second root is: 
   4
</pre>
<h2>Solving Quadratic Equations in Octave</h2>
<p>The following example solves the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> -7x +12 = 0 in Octave. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
s = roots([1, -7, 12]);

disp('The first root is: '), disp(s(1));
disp('The second root is: '), disp(s(2));
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The first root is: 
 4
The second root is: 
 3
</pre>
<h2>Solving Higher Order Equations in MATLAB</h2>
<p>The <b>solve</b> function can also solve higher order equations. For example, let us solve a cubic equation as (x-3)<sup>2</sup>(x-7) = 0</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

solve('(x-3)^2*(x-7)=0')
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
  3
  3
  7
</pre>
<p>In case of higher order equations, roots are long containing many terms. You can get the numerical value of such roots by converting them to double. The following example solves the fourth order equation x<sup>4</sup> − 7x<sup>3</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> − 5x + 9 = 0.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
eq = 'x^4 - 7*x^3 + 3*x^2 - 5*x + 9 = 0';
s = solve(eq);
disp('The first root is: '), disp(s(1));
disp('The second root is: '), disp(s(2));
disp('The third root is: '), disp(s(3));
disp('The fourth root is: '), disp(s(4));
% converting the roots to double type
disp('Numeric value of first root'), disp(double(s(1)));
disp('Numeric value of second root'), disp(double(s(2)));
disp('Numeric value of third root'), disp(double(s(3)));
disp('Numeric value of fourth root'), disp(double(s(4)));
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it returns the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The first root is: 
6.630396332390718431485053218985

 The fourth root is:

<h2>Solving System of Equations in Octave</h2>

<h1>MATLAB - Calculus</h1>
<p>MATLAB provides various ways for solving problems of differential and integral calculus, solving differential equations of any degree and calculation of limits. Best of all, you can easily plot the graphs of complex functions and check maxima, minima and other stationery points on a graph by solving the original function, as well as its derivative.</p>
<p>This chapter will deal with problems of calculus. In this chapter, we will discuss pre-calculus concepts i.e., calculating limits of functions and verifying the properties of limits.</p>
<p>In the next chapter <i>Differential</i>, we will compute derivative of an expression and find the local maxima and minima on a graph. We will also discuss solving differential equations.</p>
<p>Finally, in the <i>Integration</i> chapter, we will discuss integral calculus.</p>
<h2>Calculating Limits</h2>
<p>MATLAB provides the <b>limit</b> function for calculating limits. In its most basic form, the <b>limit</b> function takes expression as an argument and finds the limit of the expression as the independent variable goes to zero.</p>
<p>For example, let us calculate the limit of a function f(x) = (x<sup>3</sup> + 5)/(x<sup>4</sup> + 7), as x tends to zero.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
syms x
limit((x^3 + 5)/(x^4 + 7))
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =
 5/7
</pre>
<p>The limit function falls in the realm of symbolic computing; you need to use the <b>syms</b> function to tell MATLAB which symbolic variables you are using.  You can also compute limit of a function, as the variable tends to some number other than zero. To calculate lim <sub>x-&gt;a</sub>(f(x)), we use the limit command with arguments. The first being the expression and the second is the number, that <i>x</i> approaches, here it is <i>a</i>.</p>
<p>For example, let us calculate limit of a function f(x) = (x-3)/(x-1), as x tends to 1.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

limit((x - 3)/(x-1),1)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and return the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =

</pre>
<p>Let's take another example,</p>

<h2>Verification of Basic Properties of Limits</h2>
<p>Algebraic Limit Theorem provides some basic properties of limits. These are as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/calculus1.jpg" alt="Basic Properties of Limits" />
<p>Let us consider two functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>f(x) = (3x + 5)/(x - 3)</li>
<li>g(x) = x<sup>2</sup> + 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us calculate the limits of the functions as x tends to 5, of both functions and verify the basic properties of limits using these two functions and MATLAB.</p>

<h2>Left and Right Sided Limits</h2>
<p>When a function has a discontinuity for some particular value of the variable, the limit does not exist at that point. In other words, limits of a function f(x) has discontinuity at x = a, when the value of limit, as x approaches x from left side, does not equal the value of the limit as x approaches from right side.</p>
<p>This leads to the concept of left-handed and right-handed limits. A left-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the left, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &lt; a. A right-handed limit is defined as the limit as x -&gt; a, from the right, i.e., x approaches a, for values of x &gt; a. When the left-handed limit and right-handed limit are not equal, the limit does not exist.</p>
<p>Let us consider a function &minus;</p>
<p><b>f(x) = (x - 3)/|x - 3|</b></p>
<p>We will show that lim<sub>x-&gt;3</sub> f(x) does not exist. MATLAB helps us to establish this fact in two ways &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>By plotting the graph of the function and showing the discontinuity.</li>
<li>By computing the limits and showing that both are different.</li>
</ul>
<p>The left-handed and right-handed limits are computed by passing the character strings 'left' and 'right' to the limit command as the last argument.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
f = (x - 3)/abs(x-3);
ezplot(f,[-1,5])
l = limit(f,x,3,'left')
r = limit(f,x,3,'right')

<h1>MATLAB - Differential</h1>
<p>MATLAB provides the <b>diff</b> command for computing symbolic derivatives. In its simplest form, you pass the function you want to differentiate to diff command as an argument.</p>
<p>For example, let us compute the derivative of the function f(t) = 3t<sup>2</sup> + 2t<sup>-2</sup></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code into it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

<h2>Verification of Elementary Rules of Differentiation</h2>
<p>Let us briefly state various equations or rules for differentiation of functions and verify these rules. For this purpose, we will write f'(x) for a first order derivative and f"(x) for a second order derivative.</p>
<p>Following are the rules for differentiation &minus;</p>
<h3>Rule 1</h3>
<p>For any functions f and g and any real numbers a and b are the derivative of the function:</p>
<p><b>h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)</b> with respect to x is given by &minus;</p>
<p><b>h'(x) = af'(x) + bg'(x)</b></p>
<h3>Rule 2</h3>
<p>The <b>sum</b> and <b>subtraction</b> rules state that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p>(<b>f + g)' = f' + g'</b></p>
<p><b>(f - g)' = f' - g'</b></p>
<h3>Rule 3</h3>
<p>The <b>product</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p><b>(f.g)' = f'.g + g'.f</b></p>
<h3>Rule 4</h3>
<p>The <b>quotient</b> rule states that if f and g are two functions, f' and g' are their derivatives respectively, then,</p>
<p><b>(f/g)' = (f'.g - g'.f)/g<sup>2</sup></b></p>
<h3>Rule 5</h3>
<p>The <b>polynomial</b> or elementary power rule states that, if <b>y = f(x) = x<sup>n</sup></b>, then <b>f' = n. x<sup>(n-1)</sup></b></p>
<p>A direct outcome of this rule is that the derivative of any constant is zero, i.e., if <b>y = k</b>, any constant, then</p>
<p><b>f' = 0</b></p>
<h3>Rule 6</h3>
<p>The <b>chain</b> rule states that, derivative of the function of a function <b>h(x) = f(g(x))</b> with respect to x is,</p>
<p><b>h'(x)= f'(g(x)).g'(x)</b></p>

<h2>Finding the Maxima and Minima of a Curve</h2>
<p>If we are searching for the local maxima and minima for a graph, we are basically looking for the highest or lowest points on the graph of the function at a particular locality, or for a particular range of values of the symbolic variable.</p>
<p>For a function y = f(x) the points on the graph where the graph has zero slope are called <b>stationary points</b>. In other words stationary points are where f'(x) = 0.</p>
<p>To find the stationary points of a function we differentiate, we need to set the derivative equal to zero and solve the equation.</p>

<h1>MATLAB - Integration</h1>
<p>Integration deals with two essentially different types of problems.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>In the first type, derivative of a function is given and we want to find the function. Therefore, we basically reverse the process of differentiation. This reverse process is known as anti-differentiation, or finding the primitive function, or finding an <b>indefinite integral</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The second type of problems involve adding up a very large number of very small quantities and then taking a limit as the size of the quantities approaches zero, while the number of terms tend to infinity. This process leads to the definition of the <b>definite integral</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Definite integrals are used for finding area, volume, center of gravity, moment of inertia, work done by a force, and in numerous other applications.</p>

<p>By definition, if the derivative of a function f(x) is f'(x), then we say that an indefinite integral of f'(x) with respect to x is f(x).  For example, since the derivative (with respect to x) of x<sup>2</sup> is 2x, we can say that an indefinite integral of 2x is x<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>In symbols &minus;</p>
<p><b>f'(x<sup>2</sup>) = 2x</b>, therefore,</p>
<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup>.</b></p>
<p>Indefinite integral is not unique, because derivative of x<sup>2</sup> + c, for any value of a constant c, will also be 2x.</p>
<p>This is expressed in symbols as &minus;</p>
<p><b>∫ 2xdx = x<sup>2</sup> + c</b>.</p>
<p>Where, c is called an 'arbitrary constant'.</p>
<p>MATLAB provides an <b>int</b> command for calculating integral of an expression. To derive an expression for the indefinite integral of a function, we write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int(f);

<p>For example, from our previous example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

<h2>Finding Definite Integral Using MATLAB</h2>

<h2>Finding the Roots of Polynomials</h2>
<p>The <b>roots</b> function calculates the roots of a polynomial. For example, to calculate the roots of our polynomial p, type &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<h1>MATLAB - Transforms</h1>
<p>MATLAB provides command for working with transforms, such as the Laplace and Fourier transforms. Transforms are used in science and engineering as a tool for simplifying analysis and look at data from another angle.</p>
<p>For example, the Fourier transform allows us to convert a signal represented as a function of time to a function of frequency. Laplace transform allows us to convert a differential equation to an algebraic equation.</p>
<p>MATLAB provides the <b>laplace</b>, <b>fourier</b> and <b>fft</b> commands to work with Laplace, Fourier and Fast Fourier transforms.</p>
<h2>The Laplace Transform</h2>
<p>The Laplace transform of a function of time f(t) is given by the following integral &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/transforms1.jpg" alt="Laplace Transform" />
<p>Laplace transform is also denoted as transform of f(t) to F(s). You can see this transform or integration process converts f(t), a function of the symbolic variable t, into another function F(s), with another variable s.</p>
<p>Laplace transform turns differential equations into algebraic ones. To compute a Laplace transform of a function f(t), write &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
laplace(f(t))
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In this example, we will compute the Laplace transform of some commonly used functions.</p>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
syms s t a b w
laplace(a)
laplace(t^2)
laplace(t^9)
laplace(exp(-b*t))

ans =
 w/(s^2 + w^2)
  
ans =
 s/(s^2 + w^2)
</pre>
<h2>The Inverse Laplace Transform</h2>
<p>MATLAB allows us to compute the inverse Laplace transform using the command <b>ilaplace</b>.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
ilaplace(1/s^3)
</pre>
<p>MATLAB will execute the above statement and display the result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

ilaplace(1/s^7)
ilaplace(2/(w+s))
ilaplace(s/(s^2+4))
ilaplace(exp(-b*t))
ilaplace(w/(s^2 + w^2))
ilaplace(s/(s^2 + w^2))
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, it displays the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ans =

 ans =
 sin(t*w)

 ans =
 cos(t*w)
</pre>
<h2>The Fourier Transforms</h2>
<p>Fourier transforms commonly transforms a mathematical function of time, f(t), into a new function, sometimes denoted by  or F, whose argument is frequency with units of cycles/s (hertz) or radians per second. The new function is then known as the Fourier transform and/or the frequency spectrum of the function f.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Create a script file and type the following code in it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
syms x 
f = exp(-2*x^2);  %our function
ezplot(f,[-2,2])  % plot of our function
FT = fourier(f)	% Fourier transform
</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB plots the following graph &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/transforms2.jpg" alt="Fourier Transforms" />
<p>The following result is displayed &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
FT =

<h1>MATLAB - GNU Octave Tutorial</h1>
<p>GNU Octave is a high-level programming language like MATLAB and it is mostly compatible with MATLAB. It is also used for numerical computations.</p>
<p>Octave has the following common features with MATLAB &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>matrices are fundamental data type</li>
<li>it has built-in support for complex numbers</li>
<li>it has built-in math functions and libraries</li>
<li>it supports user-defined functions</li>
</ul>
<p>GNU Octave is also freely redistributable software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<h2>MATLAB vs Octave</h2>
<p>Most MATLAB programs run in Octave, but some of the Octave programs may not run in MATLAB because, Octave allows some syntax that MATLAB does not.</p>
<p>For example, MATLAB supports single quotes only, but Octave supports both single and double quotes for defining strings. If you are looking for a tutorial on Octave, then  kindly go through this tutorial from beginning which covers both MATLAB as well as Octave.</p>
<h3>Compatible Examples</h3>
<p>Almost all the examples covered in this tutorial are compatible with MATLAB as well as Octave. Let's try following example in MATLAB and Octave which produces same result without any syntax changes &minus;</p>
<p>This example creates a 3D surface map for the function g = xe<sup>-(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</sup>. Create a script file and type the following code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

</pre>
<p>When you run the file, MATLAB displays the following 3-D map &minus;</p>
<img src="/matlab/images/graphics4.jpg" alt="3-D Map in Matlab" />
<h3>Non-compatible Examples</h3>
<p>Though all the core functionality of MATLAB is available in Octave, there are some functionality for example, Differential &amp; Integration Calculus, which does not match exactly in both the languages. This tutorial has tried to give both type of examples where they differed in their syntax.</p>
<p>Consider following example where MATLAB and Octave make use of different functions to get the area of a curve: f(x) = x<sup>2</sup> cos(x) for −4 ≤ x ≤ 9. Following is MATLAB version of the code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
f = x^2*cos(x);

8*cos(4) + 18*cos(9) + 14*sin(4) + 79*sin(9)
 
Area: 
    0.3326
