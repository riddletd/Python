<title>R Overview</title>

<h1>R - Overview</h1>

<p>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team.</p>

<p>The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. R allows integration with the procedures written in the C, C&plus;&plus;, .Net, Python or FORTRAN languages for efficiency.</p>

<p>R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copy left, and an official part of the GNU project called <b>GNU S</b>.</p>

<h2>Evolution of R</h2>

<p>R was initially written by <b>Ross Ihaka</b> and <b>Robert Gentleman</b> at the Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. R made its first appearance in 1993.</p>

<p>A large group of individuals has contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.</p>

<p>Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the "R Core Team") who can modify the R source code archive.</p>

<h2>Features of R</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. The following are the important features of R &minus;</p>

<p>R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.</p>

<p>R has an effective data handling and storage facility,</p>

<p>R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.</p>

<p>R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, R is world’s most widely used statistics programming language. It's the # 1 choice of data scientists and supported by a vibrant and talented community of contributors. R is taught in universities and deployed in mission critical business applications. This tutorial will teach you R programming along with suitable examples in simple and easy steps.</p>

<title>R Environment Setup</title>

<h1>R - Environment Setup</h1>

<h2>Try it Option Online</h2>

<p>You really do not need to set up your own environment to start learning R programming language. Reason is very simple, we already have set up R Programming environment online, so that you can compile and execute all the available examples online at the same time when you are doing your theory work. This gives you confidence in what you are reading and to check the result with different options. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

<p>Try the following example using <b>Try it</b> option at the website available at the top right corner of the below sample code box &minus;</p>

<p>For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find <b>Try it</b> option at the website, so just make use of it and enjoy your learning.</p>

<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>

<p>If you are still willing to set up your environment for R, you can follow the steps given below.</p>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3>

<p>You can download the Windows installer version of R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R-3.2.2 for Windows (32/64 bit)</a> and save it in a local directory.</p>

<p>As it is a Windows installer (.exe) with a name "R-version-win.exe". You can just double click and run the installer accepting the default settings. If your Windows is 32-bit version, it installs the 32-bit version. But if your windows is 64-bit, then it installs both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>

<p>After installation you can locate the icon to run the Program in a directory structure "R\R3.2.2\bin\i386\Rgui.exe" under the Windows Program Files. Clicking this icon brings up the R-GUI which is the R console to do R Programming.</p>

<h3>Linux Installation</h3>

<p>R is available as a binary for many versions of Linux at the location <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Binaries</a>.</p>

<p>The instruction to install Linux varies from flavor to flavor. These steps are mentioned under each type of Linux version in the mentioned link. However, if you are in a hurry, then you can use <b>yum</b> command to install R as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Above command will install core functionality of R programming along with standard packages, still you need additional package, then you can launch R prompt as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Now you can use install command at R prompt to install the required package. For example, the following command will install <b>plotrix</b> package which is required for 3D charts.</p>

<title>R Basic Syntax</title>

<h1>R - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>As a convention, we will start learning R programming by writing a "Hello, World!" program. Depending on the needs, you can program either at R command prompt or you can use an R script file to write your program. Let's check both one by one.</p>

<h2>R Command Prompt</h2>

<p>Once you have R environment setup, then it’s easy to start your R command prompt by just typing the following command at your command prompt &minus;</p>

<p>This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt &gt; where you can start typing your program as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Here first statement defines a string variable myString, where we assign a string "Hello, World!" and then next statement print() is being used to print the value stored in variable myString.</p>

<h2>R Script File</h2>

<p>Usually, you will do your programming by writing your programs in script files and then you execute those scripts at your command prompt with the help of R interpreter called <b>Rscript</b>. So let's start with writing following code in a text file called test.R as under &minus;</p>

<p>Save the above code in a file test.R and execute it at Linux command prompt as given below. Even if you are using Windows or other system, syntax will remain same.</p>

<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows &minus;</p>

<p>R does not support multi-line comments but you can perform a trick which is something as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Though above comments will be executed by R interpreter, they will not interfere with your actual program. You should put such comments inside, either single or double quote.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
$ R
</pre>
<p>This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt &gt; where you can start typing your program as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&gt; myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"
&gt; print ( myString)
[1] "Hello, World!"
</pre>
<p>Here first statement defines a string variable myString, where we assign a string "Hello, World!" and then next statement print() is being used to print the value stored in variable myString.</p>
<h2>R Script File</h2>
<p>Usually, you will do your programming by writing your programs in script files and then you execute those scripts at your command prompt with the help of R interpreter called <b>Rscript</b>. So let's start with writing following code in a text file called test.R as under &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# My first program in R Programming
myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"

print ( myString)
</pre>
<p>Save the above code in a file test.R and execute it at Linux command prompt as given below. Even if you are using Windows or other system, syntax will remain same.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ Rscript test.R 
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "Hello, World!"
</pre>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
# My first program in R Programming
</pre>
<p>R does not support multi-line comments but you can perform a trick which is something as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
if(FALSE) {
   "This is a demo for multi-line comments and it should be put inside either a single
      OR double quote"
}

myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)
</pre>

<title>R Data Types</title>

<h1>R - Data Types</h1>

<p>Generally, while doing programming in any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that, when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>

<p>You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, Boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>

<p>In contrast to other programming languages like C and java in R, the variables are not declared as some data type. The variables are assigned with R-Objects and the data type of the R-object becomes the data type of the variable. There are many types of R-objects. The frequently used ones are &minus;</p>

<p>The simplest of these objects is the <b>vector object</b> and there are six data types of these atomic vectors, also termed as six classes of vectors. The other R-Objects are built upon the atomic vectors.</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In R programming, the very basic data types are the R-objects called <b>vectors</b> which hold elements of different classes as shown above. Please note in R the number of classes is not confined to only the above six types. For example, we can use many atomic vectors and create an array whose class will become array.</p>

<h2>Vectors</h2>

<p>When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use <b>c()</b> function which means to combine the elements into a vector.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, functions and even another list inside it.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Matrices</h2>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension. In the below example we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Factors</h2>

<p>Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.</p>

<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor()</b> function.The <b>nlevels</b> functions gives the count of levels.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Frames</h2>

<p>Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list of vectors of equal length.</p>

<p>Data Frames are created using the <b>data.frame()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use <b>c()</b> function which means to combine the elements into a vector.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector.
apple &lt;- c('red','green',"yellow")

<h2>Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a matrix.
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension. In the below example we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create an array.
a &lt;- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(a)

<p>Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.</p>
<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor()</b> function.The <b>nlevels</b> functions gives the count of levels.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector.
apple_colors &lt;- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')

# Create a factor object.
factor_apple &lt;- factor(apple_colors)

# Print the factor.
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))

<title>R Variables</title>

<h1>R - Variables</h1>

<p>A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. A variable in R can store an atomic vector, group of atomic vectors or a combination of many Robjects. A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number.</p>

<h2>Variable Assignment</h2>

<p>The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values of the variables can be printed using <b>print()</b> or <b>cat()</b>function. The <b>cat()</b> function combines multiple items into a continuous print output.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The vector c(TRUE,1) has a mix of logical and numeric class. So logical class is coerced to numeric class making TRUE as 1.</p>

<h2>Data Type of a Variable</h2>

<p>In R, a variable itself is not declared of any data type, rather it gets the data type of the R - object assigned to it. So R is called a dynamically typed language, which means that we can change a variable’s data type of the same variable again and again when using it in a program.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding Variables</h2>

<p>To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the <b>ls()</b> function. Also the ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; It is a sample output depending on what variables are declared in your environment.</p>

<p>The ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The variables starting with <b>dot(.)</b> are hidden, they can be listed using "all.names = TRUE" argument to ls() function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Deleting Variables</h2>

<p>Variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> function. Below we delete the variable var.3. On printing the value of the variable error is thrown.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>All the variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> and <b>ls()</b> function together.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

      Next the class of var_x becomes  integer
</pre>
<h2>Finding Variables</h2>
<p>To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the <b>ls()</b> function. Also the ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p> 
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
print(ls())
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "my var"     "my_new_var" "my_var"     "var.1"      
[5] "var.2"      "var.3"      "var.name"   "var_name2."
[9] "var_x"      "varname" 
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; It is a sample output depending on what variables are declared in your environment.</p>
<p>The ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
print(ls(pattern = "var"))   
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "my var"     "my_new_var" "my_var"     "var.1"      
[5] "var.2"      "var.3"      "var.name"   "var_name2."
[9] "var_x"      "varname"    
</pre>
<p>The variables starting with <b>dot(.)</b> are hidden, they can be listed using "all.names = TRUE" argument to ls() function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
print(ls(all.name = TRUE))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] ".cars"        ".Random.seed" ".var_name"    ".varname"     ".varname2"

[11]"var.3"        "var.name"     "var_name2."   "var_x"  
</pre>
<h2>Deleting Variables</h2>
<p>Variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> function. Below we delete the variable var.3. On printing the value of the variable error is thrown.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
rm(var.3)
print(var.3)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<title>R Decision making</title>

<h1>R - Decision making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require the programmer to specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>R provides the following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional <b>else</b> statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p>

<p>A <b>switch</b> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<title>R Loops</title>

<h1>R - Loops</h1>

<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>R programming language provides the following kinds of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>

<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

<p>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>R supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>Terminates the <b>loop</b> statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>

<p>The <b>next</b> statement simulates the behavior of R switch.</p>

<title>R Functions</title>

<h1>R - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions.</p>

<p>In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments that may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions.</p>

<p>The function in turn performs its task and returns control to the interpreter as well as any result which may be stored in other objects.</p>

<h2>Function Definition</h2>

<p>An R function is created by using the keyword <b>function</b>. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Function Components </h2>

<p>The different parts of a function are &minus;</p>

<p><b>Function Name</b> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.</p>

<p><b>Arguments</b> &minus; An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.</p>

<p><b>Function Body</b> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.</p>

<p>R has many <b>in-built</b> functions which can be directly called in the program without defining them first. We can also create and use our own functions referred as <b>user defined</b> functions.</p>

<h2>Built-in Function</h2>

<p>Simple examples of in-built functions are <b>seq()</b>, <b>mean()</b>, <b>max()</b>, <b>sum(x)</b> and <b>paste(...)</b> etc. They are directly called by user written programs. You can refer <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most widely used R functions.</a></p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>User-defined Function</h2>

<p>We can create user-defined functions in R. They are specific to what a user wants and once created they can be used like the built-in functions. Below is an example of how a function is created and used.</p>

<h2>Calling a Function</h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Calling a Function without an Argument</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Calling a Function with Argument Values (by position and by name)</h3>

<p>The arguments to a function call can be supplied in the same sequence as defined in the function or they can be supplied in a different sequence but assigned to the names of the arguments.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Calling a Function with Default Argument</h3>

<p>We can define the value of the arguments in the function definition and call the function without supplying any argument to get the default result. But we can also call such functions by supplying new values of the argument and get non default result.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Lazy Evaluation of Function</h3>

<p>Arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, which means so they are evaluated only when needed by the function body.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<li><p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>R has many <b>in-built</b> functions which can be directly called in the program without defining them first. We can also create and use our own functions referred as <b>user defined</b> functions.</p>
<h2>Built-in Function</h2>
<p>Simple examples of in-built functions are <b>seq()</b>, <b>mean()</b>, <b>max()</b>, <b>sum(x)</b> and <b>paste(...)</b> etc. They are directly called by user written programs. You can refer <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most widely used R functions.</a></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a sequence of numbers from 32 to 44.
print(seq(32,44))

# Find mean of numbers from 25 to 82.
print(mean(25:82))

# Find sum of numbers frm 41 to 68.
print(sum(41:68))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p> 
<pre class="result notranslate">

[1] 53.5
[1] 1526
</pre>
<h2>User-defined Function</h2>
<p>We can create user-defined functions in R. They are specific to what a user wants and once created they can be used like the built-in functions. Below is an example of how a function is created and used.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function to print squares of numbers in sequence.
new.function &lt;- function(a) {
   for(i in 1:a) {
      b &lt;- i^2
      print(b)
   }
}	
</pre>
<h2>Calling a Function</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function to print squares of numbers in sequence.
new.function &lt;- function(a) {
   for(i in 1:a) {
      b &lt;- i^2
      print(b)
   }
}

# Call the function new.function supplying 6 as an argument.
new.function(6)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p> 
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 1
[1] 4
[1] 9
[1] 16
[1] 25
[1] 36
</pre>
<h3>Calling a Function without an Argument</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function without an argument.
new.function &lt;- function() {
   for(i in 1:5) {
      print(i^2)
   }
}	

# Call the function without supplying an argument.
new.function()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 1
[1] 4
[1] 9
[1] 16
[1] 25
</pre>
<h3>Calling a Function with Argument Values (by position and by name)</h3>
<p>The arguments to a function call can be supplied in the same sequence as defined in the function or they can be supplied in a different sequence but assigned to the names of the arguments.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function with arguments.
new.function &lt;- function(a,b,c) {
   result &lt;- a * b + c
   print(result)
}

# Call the function by position of arguments.
new.function(5,3,11)

# Call the function by names of the arguments.
new.function(a = 11, b = 5, c = 3)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 26
[1] 58
</pre>
<h3>Calling a Function with Default Argument</h3>
<p>We can define the value of the arguments in the function definition and call the function without supplying any argument to get the default result. But we can also call such functions by supplying new values of the argument and get non default result.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function with arguments.
new.function &lt;- function(a = 3, b = 6) {
   result &lt;- a * b
   print(result)
}

# Call the function without giving any argument.
new.function()

# Call the function with giving new values of the argument.
new.function(9,5)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 18
[1] 45
</pre>
<h3>Lazy Evaluation of Function</h3>
<p>Arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, which means so they are evaluated only when needed by the function body.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a function with arguments.
new.function &lt;- function(a, b) {
   print(a^2)
   print(a)
   print(b)
}

# Evaluate the function without supplying one of the arguments.
new.function(6)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<title>R Strings</title>

<h1>R - Strings</h1>

<p>Any value written within a pair of single quote or double quotes in R is treated as a string. Internally R stores every string within double quotes, even when you create them with single quote.</p>

<h2>Rules Applied in String Construction</h2>

<p>The quotes at the beginning and end of a string should be both double quotes or both single quote. They can not be mixed.</p>

<p>Double quotes can be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p>

<p>Single quote can be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p>

<p>Double quotes can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p>

<p>Single quote can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p>

<h3>Examples of Valid Strings</h3>

<title>R Vectors</title>

<h1>R - Vectors</h1>

<p>Vectors are the most basic R data objects and there are six types of atomic vectors. They are logical, integer, double, complex, character and raw.</p>

<h2>Vector Creation</h2>

<h3>Single Element Vector</h3>

<p>Even when you write just one value in R, it becomes a vector of length 1 and belongs to one of the above vector types.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Multiple Elements Vector</h3>

<p><b>Using colon operator with numeric data</b></p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Using sequence (Seq.) operator</b></p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Using the c() function</b></p>

<p>The non-character values are coerced to character type if one of the elements is a character.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Vector Elements</h2>

<p>Elements of a Vector are accessed using indexing. The <b>[ ] brackets</b> are used for indexing. Indexing starts with position 1. Giving a negative value in the index drops that element from result.<b>TRUE</b>,<b> FALSE</b> or <b>0</b> and <b>1</b> can also be used for indexing.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Vector Manipulation</h2>

<h3>Vector arithmetic</h3>

<h3>Vector element recycling</h3>

<p>If we apply arithmetic operations to two vectors of unequal length, then the elements of the shorter vector are recycled to complete the operations.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Vector Element Sorting</h3>

<p>Elements in a vector can be sorted using the <b>sort()</b> function.</p>

<title>R Matrices</title>

<h1> R - Matrices</h1>

<p>Matrices are the R objects in which the elements are arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout. They contain elements of the same atomic types. Though we can create a matrix containing only characters or only logical values, they are not of much use. We use matrices containing numeric elements to be used in mathematical calculations.</p>

<p>A Matrix is created using the <b>matrix()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a matrix in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the input vector which becomes the data elements of the matrix.</p>

<p><b>nrow</b> is the number of rows to be created.</p>

<p><b>ncol</b> is the number of columns to be created.</p>

<p><b>byrow</b> is a logical clue. If TRUE then the input vector elements are arranged by row.</p>

<p><b>dimname</b> is the names assigned to the rows and columns.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Create a matrix taking a vector of numbers as input</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Elements of a Matrix</h2>

<p>Elements of a matrix can be accessed by using the column and row index of the element. We consider the matrix P above to find the specific elements below.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Matrix Computations</h2>

<p>Various mathematical operations are performed on the matrices using the R operators. The result of the operation is also a matrix.</p>

<p>The dimensions (number of rows and columns) should be same for the matrices involved in the operation.</p>

<title>R Factors</title>

<h1>R - Factors</h1>

<p>Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns which have a limited number of unique values. Like "Male, "Female" and True, False etc. They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.</p>

<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor ()</b> function by taking a vector as input.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Factors in Data Frame</h2>

<p>On creating any data frame with a column of text data, R treats the text column as categorical data and creates factors on it.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Changing the Order of Levels</h2>

<p>The order of the levels in a factor can be changed by applying the factor function again with new order of the levels.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Generating Factor Levels</h2>

<p>We can generate factor levels by using the <b>gl()</b> function. It takes two integers as input which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>n</b> is a integer giving the number of levels.</p>

<p><b>k</b> is a integer giving the number of replications.</p>

<h2>Factors in Data Frame</h2>
<p>On creating any data frame with a column of text data, R treats the text column as categorical data and creates factors on it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the vectors for data frame.
height &lt;- c(132,151,162,139,166,147,122)
weight &lt;- c(48,49,66,53,67,52,40)
gender &lt;- c("male","male","female","female","male","female","male")

# Create the data frame.
input_data &lt;- data.frame(height,weight,gender)
print(input_data)

# Test if the gender column is a factor.
print(is.factor(input_data$gender))

# Print the gender column so see the levels.
print(input_data$gender)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h2>Changing the Order of Levels</h2>
<p>The order of the levels in a factor can be changed by applying the factor function again with new order of the levels.</p>

Levels: East North West
 [1] East  West  East  North North East  West  West  West  East  North
Levels: East West North
</pre>
<h2>Generating Factor Levels</h2>
<p>We can generate factor levels by using the <b>gl()</b> function. It takes two integers as input which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
gl(n, k, labels)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>n</b> is a integer giving the number of levels.</p></li>
<li><p><b>k</b> is a integer giving the number of replications.</p></li>
<li><p><b>labels</b> is a vector of labels for the resulting factor levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
v &lt;- gl(3, 4, labels = c("Tampa", "Seattle","Boston"))
print(v)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Tampa   Tampa   Tampa   Tampa   Seattle Seattle Seattle Seattle Boston 
[10] Boston  Boston  Boston 
Levels: Tampa Seattle Boston

<title>R Data Frames</title>

<h1>R - Data Frames</h1>

<p>A data frame is a table or a two-dimensional array-like structure in which each column contains values of one variable and each row contains one set of values from each column.</p>

<p>Following are the characteristics of a data frame.</p>

<h2>Create Data Frame </h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Get the Structure of the Data Frame</h2>

<p>The structure of the data frame can be seen by using <b>str()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Summary of Data in Data Frame</h2>

<p>The statistical summary and nature of the data can be obtained by applying <b>summary()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Extract Data from Data Frame</h2>

<p>Extract specific column from a data frame using column name.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Extract the first two rows and then all columns</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Extract 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> row with 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> column</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Expand Data Frame</h2>

<p>A data frame can be expanded by adding columns and rows.</p>

<h3>Add Column</h3>

<p>Just add the column vector using a new column name.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Add Row</h3>

<p>To add more rows permanently to an existing data frame, we need to bring in the new rows in the same structure as the existing data frame and use the <b>rbind()</b> function.</p>

<p>In the example below we create a data frame with new rows and merge it with the existing data frame to create the final data frame.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>R Packages</title>

<h1>R - Packages</h1>

<p>R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory called <b>"library"</b> in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them.</p>

<p>All the packages available in R language are listed at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Packages.</a></p>

<p>Below is a list of commands to be used to check, verify and use the R packages.</p>

<h2>Check Available R Packages</h2>

<p>Get library locations containing R packages</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<h2>Get the list of all the packages installed</h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<p>Get all packages currently loaded in the R environment</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<h2>Install a New Package</h2>

<p>There are two ways to add new R packages. One is installing directly from the CRAN directory and another is downloading the package to your local system and installing it manually.</p>

<h3>Install directly from CRAN</h3>

<p>The following command gets the packages directly from CRAN webpage and installs the package in the R environment. You may be prompted to choose a nearest mirror. Choose the one appropriate to your location.</p>

<h3>Install package manually</h3>

<p>Go to the link <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">R Packages</a> to download the package needed. Save the package as a <b>.zip</b> file in a suitable location in the local system.</p>

<p>Now you can run the following command to install this package in the R environment.</p>

<h2>Load Package to Library</h2>

<p>Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment. You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available in the current environment.</p>

<p>A package is loaded using the following command &minus;</p>

<title>R Data Reshaping</title>

<h1>R - Data Reshaping</h1>

<p>Data Reshaping in R is about changing the way data is organized into rows and columns. Most of the time data processing in R is done by taking the input data as a data frame. It is easy to extract data from the rows and columns of a data frame but there are situations when we need the data frame in a format that is different from format in which we received it. R has many functions to split, merge and change the rows to columns and vice-versa in a data frame.</p>

<h2>Joining Columns and Rows in a Data Frame</h2>

<p>We can join multiple vectors to create a data frame using the <b>cbind()</b>function. Also we can merge two data frames using <b>rbind()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Merging Data Frames</h2>

<p>We can merge two data frames by using the <b>merge()</b> function. The data frames must have same column names on which the merging happens.</p>

<p>In the example below, we consider the data sets about Diabetes in Pima Indian Women available in the library names "MASS". we merge the two data sets based on the values of blood pressure("bp") and body mass index("bmi"). On choosing these two columns for merging, the records where values of these two variables match in both data sets are combined together to form a single data frame.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Melting and Casting</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of R programming is about changing the shape of the data in multiple steps to get a desired shape. The functions used to do this are called <b>melt()</b> and <b>cast()</b>.</p>

<p>We consider the dataset called ships present in the library called "MASS".</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Melt the Data</h2>

<p>Now we melt the data to organize it, converting all columns other than type and year into multiple rows.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Cast the Molten Data</h2>

<p>We can cast the molten data into a new form where the aggregate of each type of ship for each year is created. It is done using the <b>cast()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>R CSV Files</title>

<h1>R - CSV Files</h1>

<p>In R, we can read data from files stored outside the R environment. We can also write data into files which will be stored and accessed by the operating system. R can read and write into various file formats like csv, excel, xml etc.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will learn to read data from a csv file and then write data into a csv file. The file should be present in current working directory so that R can read it. Of course we can also set our own directory and read files from there.</p>

<h2>Getting and Setting the Working Directory</h2>

<p>You can check which directory the R workspace is pointing to using the <b>getwd()</b> function. You can also set a new working directory using <b>setwd()</b>function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result depends on your OS and your current directory where you are working.</p>

<h2>Input as CSV File</h2>

<p>The csv file is a text file in which the values in the columns are separated by a comma. Let's consider the following data present in the file named <b>input.csv</b>.</p>

<p>You can create this file using windows notepad by copying and pasting this data. Save the file as <b>input.csv</b> using the save As All files(*.*) option in notepad.</p>

<h2>Reading a CSV File</h2>

<p>Following is a simple example of <b>read.csv()</b> function to read a CSV file available in your current working directory &minus;</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Analyzing the CSV File</h2>

<p>By default the <b>read.csv()</b> function gives the output as a data frame. This can be easily checked as follows. Also we can check the number of columns and rows.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Once we read data in a data frame, we can apply all the functions applicable to data frames as explained in subsequent section.</p>

<h3>Get the maximum salary</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get the details of the person with max salary</h3>

<p>We can fetch rows meeting specific filter criteria similar to a SQL where clause.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get all the people working in IT department</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get the persons in IT department whose salary is greater than 600</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get the people who joined on or after 2014</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Writing into a CSV File</h2>

<p>R can create csv file form existing data frame. The <b>write.csv()</b> function is used to create the csv file. This file gets created in the working directory.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here the column X comes from the data set newper. This can be dropped using additional parameters while writing the file.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>R Excel File</title>

<h1>R - Excel File</h1>

<p>Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program which stores data in the .xls or .xlsx format. R can read directly from these files using some excel specific packages. Few such packages are - XLConnect, xlsx, gdata etc. We will be using xlsx package. R can also write into excel file using this package.</p>

<h2>Install xlsx Package</h2>

<p>You can use the following command in the R console to install the "xlsx" package. It may ask to install some additional packages on which this package is dependent. Follow the same command with required package name to install the additional packages.</p>

<h2>Verify and Load the "xlsx" Package</h2>

<p>Use the following command to verify and load the "xlsx" package.</p>

<p>When the script is run we get the following output.</p>

<h2>Input as xlsx File</h2>

<p>Open Microsoft excel. Copy and paste the following data in the work sheet named as sheet1.</p>

<p>Also copy and paste the following data to another worksheet and rename this worksheet to "city".</p>

<p>Save the Excel file as "input.xlsx". You should save it in the current working directory of the R workspace.</p>

<h2>Reading the Excel File</h2>

<p>The input.xlsx is read by using the <b>read.xlsx()</b> function as shown below. The result is stored as a data frame in the R environment.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>R Binary Files</title>

<h1>R - Binary Files</h1>

<p>A binary file is a file that contains information stored only in form of bits and bytes.(0’s and 1’s). They are not human readable as the bytes in it translate to characters and symbols which contain many other non-printable characters. Attempting to read a binary file using any text editor will show characters like &Oslash; and &eth;.</p>

<p>The binary file has to be read by specific programs to be useable. For example, the binary file of a Microsoft Word program can be read to a human readable form only by the Word program. Which indicates that, besides the human readable text, there is a lot more information like formatting of characters and page numbers etc., which are also stored along with alphanumeric characters. And finally a binary file is a continuous sequence of bytes. The line break we see in a text file is a character joining first line to the next.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the data generated by other programs are required to be processed by R as a binary file. Also R is required to create binary files which can be shared with other programs.</p>

<p>R has two functions <b>WriteBin()</b> and <b>readBin()</b> to create and read binary files.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>con</b> is the connection object to read or write the binary file.</p>

<p><b>object</b> is the binary file which to be written.</p>

<p><b>what</b> is the mode like character, integer etc. representing the bytes to be read.</p>

<p><b>n</b> is the number of bytes to read from the binary file.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We consider the R inbuilt data "mtcars". First we create a csv file from it and convert it to a binary file and store it as a OS file. Next we read this binary file created into R.</p>

<h2>Writing the Binary File</h2>

<p>We read the data frame "mtcars" as a csv file and then write it as a binary file to the OS.</p>

<h2>Reading the Binary File</h2>

<p>The binary file created above stores all the data as continuous bytes. So we will read it by choosing appropriate values of column names as well as the column values.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>As we can see, we got the original data back by reading the binary file in R.</p>

<title>R XML Files</title>

<h1>R - XML Files</h1>

<p>XML is a file format which shares both the file format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. It stands for Extensible Markup Language (XML). Similar to HTML it contains markup tags. But unlike HTML where the markup tag describes structure of the page, in xml the markup tags describe the meaning of the data contained into he file.</p>

<p>You can read a xml file in R using the "XML" package. This package can be installed using following command.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>Create a XMl file by copying the below data into a text editor like notepad. Save the file with a <b>.xml</b> extension and choosing the file type as <b>all files(*.*)</b>.</p>

<h2>Reading XML File</h2>

<p>The xml file is read by R using the function <b>xmlParse()</b>. It is stored as a list in R.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get Number of Nodes Present in XML File</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Details of the First Node</h2>

<p>Let's look at the first record of the parsed file. It will give us an idea of the various elements present in the top level node.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get Different Elements of a Node</h3>

<h2>XML to Data Frame</h2>

<p>To handle the data effectively in large files we read the data in the xml file as a data frame. Then process the data frame for data analysis.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>As the data is now available as a dataframe we can use data frame related function to read and manipulate the file.</p>

<title>R Web Data</title>

<h1>R - Web Data</h1>

<p>Many websites provide data for consumption by its users. For example the World Health Organization(WHO) provides reports on health and medical information in the form of CSV, txt and XML files. Using R programs, we can programmatically extract specific data from such websites. Some packages in R which are used to scrap data form the web are &minus; "RCurl",XML", and "stringr". They are used to connect to the URL’s, identify required links for the files and download them to the local environment.</p>

<h2>Install R Packages</h2>

<p>The following packages are required for processing the URL’s and links to the files. If they are not available in your R Environment, you can install them using following commands.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>We will visit the URL <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">weather data</a> and download the CSV files using R for the year 2015.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will use the function <b>getHTMLLinks()</b> to gather the URLs of the files. Then we will use the function <b>downlaod.file()</b> to save the files to the local system. As we will be applying the same code again and again for multiple files, we will create a function to be called multiple times. The filenames are passed as parameters in form of a R list object to this function.</p>

<h2>Verify the File Download</h2>

<p>After running the above code, you can locate the following files in the current R working directory.</p>

<title>R Databases</title>

<h1>R - Databases</h1>

<p>The data is Relational database systems are stored in a normalized format. So, to carry out statistical computing we will need very advanced and complex Sql queries. But R can connect easily to many relational databases like MySql, Oracle, Sql server etc. and fetch records from them as a data frame. Once the data is available in the R environment, it becomes a normal R data set and can be manipulated or analyzed using all the powerful packages and functions.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will be using MySql as our reference database for connecting to R.</p>

<h2>RMySQL Package</h2>

<p>R has a built-in package named "RMySQL" which provides native connectivity between with MySql database. You can install this package in the R environment using the following command.</p>

<h2>Connecting R to MySql</h2>

<p>Once the package is installed we create a connection object in R to connect to the database. It takes the username, password, database name and host name as input.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Querying the Tables</h2>

<p>We can query the database tables in MySql using the function <b>dbSendQuery()</b>. The query gets executed in MySql and the result set is returned using the R <b>fetch()</b> function. Finally it is stored as a data frame in R.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Query with Filter Clause</h2>

<p>We can pass any valid select query to get the result.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Rows in the Tables</h2>

<p>We can update the rows in a Mysql table by passing the update query to the dbSendQuery() function.</p>

<p>After executing the above code we can see the table updated in the MySql Environment.</p>

<h2>Inserting Data into the Tables</h2>

<p>After executing the above code we can see the row inserted into the table in the MySql Environment.</p>

<h2>Creating Tables in MySql</h2>

<p>We can create tables in the MySql using the function <b>dbWriteTable()</b>. It overwrites the table if it already exists and takes a data frame as input.</p>

<p>After executing the above code we can see the table created in the MySql Environment.</p>

<h2>Dropping Tables in MySql</h2>

<p>We can drop the tables in MySql database passing the drop table statement into the dbSendQuery() in the same way we used it for querying data from tables.</p>

<p>After executing the above code we can see the table is dropped in the MySql Environment.</p>

<title>R Pie Charts</title>

<h1>R - Pie Charts</h1>

<p>R Programming language has numerous libraries to create charts and graphs. A pie-chart is a representation of values as slices of a circle with different colors. The slices are labeled and the numbers corresponding to each slice is also represented in the chart.</p>

<p>In R the pie chart is created using the <b>pie()</b> function which takes positive numbers as a vector input. The additional parameters are used to control labels, color, title etc.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a pie-chart using the R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is a vector containing the numeric values used in the pie chart.</p>

<p><b>labels</b> is used to give description to the slices.</p>

<p><b>radius</b> indicates the radius of the circle of the pie chart.(value between &minus;1 and &plus;1).</p>

<p><b>main</b> indicates the title of the chart.</p>

<p><b>col</b> indicates the color palette.</p>

<p><b>clockwise</b> is a logical value indicating if the slices are drawn clockwise or anti clockwise.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>A very simple pie-chart is created using just the input vector and labels. The below script will create and save the pie chart in the current R working directory.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Pie Chart Title and Colors</h2>

<p>We can expand the features of the chart by adding more parameters to the function. We will use parameter <b>main</b> to add a title to the chart and another parameter is <b>col</b> which will make use of rainbow colour pallet while drawing the chart. The length of the pallet should be same as the number of values we have for the chart. Hence we use length(x).</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The below script will create and save the pie chart in the current R working directory.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Slice Percentages and Chart Legend</h2>

<p>We can add slice percentage and a chart legend by creating additional chart variables.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>3D Pie Chart</h2>

<p>A pie chart with 3 dimensions can be drawn using additional packages. The package <b>plotrix</b> has a function called <b>pie3D()</b> that is used for this.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>R Bar Charts</title>

<h1>R - Bar Charts</h1>

<p>A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of the variable. R uses the function <b>barplot()</b> to create bar charts. R can draw both vertical and horizontal bars in the bar chart. In bar chart each of the bars can be given different colors.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax to create a bar-chart in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>H</b> is a vector or matrix containing numeric values used in bar chart.</p>

<p><b>xlab</b> is the label for x axis.</p>

<p><b>ylab</b> is the label for y axis.</p>

<p><b>main</b> is the title of the bar chart.</p>

<p><b>names.arg</b> is a vector of names appearing under each bar.</p>

<p><b>col</b> is used to give colors to the bars in the graph.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>A simple bar chart is created using just the input vector and the name of each bar.</p>

<p>The below script will create and save the bar chart in the current R working directory.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Bar Chart Labels, Title and Colors</h2>

<p>The features of the bar chart can be expanded by adding more parameters. The <b>main</b> parameter is used to add <b>title</b>. The <b>col</b> parameter is used to add colors to the bars.

<title>R Boxplots</title>

<h1>R - Boxplots</h1>

<p>Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set. It is also useful in comparing the distribution of data across data sets by drawing boxplots for each of them.</p>

<p>Boxplots are created in R by using the <b>boxplot()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><b>trim</b> is used to drop some observations from both end of the sorted vector.</p>

<p><b>na.rm</b> is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Applying Trim Option</h2>

<p>When trim parameter is supplied, the values in the vector get sorted and then the required numbers of observations are dropped from calculating the mean.</p>

<p>When trim = 0.3, 3 values from each end will be dropped from the calculations to find mean.</p>

<p>In this case the sorted vector is (&minus;21, &minus;5, 2, 3, 4.2, 7, 8, 12, 18, 54) and the values removed from the vector for calculating mean are (&minus;21,&minus;5,2) from left and (12,18,54) from right.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Applying NA Option</h2>

<p>If there are missing values, then the mean function returns NA.</p>

<p>To drop the missing values from the calculation use na.rm = TRUE. which means remove the NA values.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Median</h2>

<p>The middle most value in a data series is called the median. The <b>median()</b> function is used in R to calculate this value.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The basic syntax for calculating median in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the input vector.</p>

<p><b>na.rm</b> is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Mode</h2>

<p>The mode is the value that has highest number of occurrences in a set of data. Unike mean and median, mode can have both numeric and character data.</p>

<p>R does not have a standard in-built function to calculate mode. So we create a user function to calculate mode of a data set in R. This function takes the vector as input and gives the mode value as output.</p>

<title>R Linear Regression</title>

<h1>R - Linear Regression</h1>

<p>Regression analysis is a very widely used statistical tool to establish a relationship model between two variables. One of these variable is called predictor variable whose value is gathered through experiments. The other variable is called response variable whose value is derived from the predictor variable.</p>

<p>In Linear Regression these two variables are related through an equation, where exponent (power) of both these variables is 1. Mathematically a linear relationship represents a straight line when plotted as a graph. A non-linear relationship where the exponent of any variable is not equal to 1 creates a curve.</p>

<p>The general mathematical equation for a linear regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>y</b> is the response variable.</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the predictor variable.</p>

<p><b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are constants which are called the coefficients.</p>

<h2>Steps to Establish a Regression</h2>

<p>A simple example of regression is predicting weight of a person when his height is known. To do this we need to have the relationship between height and weight of a person.</p>

<p>The steps to create the relationship is &minus;</p>

<p>Carry out the experiment of gathering a sample of observed values of height and corresponding weight.</p>

<p>Create a relationship model using the <b>lm()</b> functions in R.</p>

<p>Find the coefficients from the model created and create the mathematical equation using these</p>

<p>Get a summary of the relationship model to know the average error in prediction. Also called <b>residuals</b>.</p>

<p>To predict the weight of new persons, use the <b>predict()</b> function in R.</p>

<title>R Multiple Regression</title>

<h1>R - Multiple Regression</h1>

<p>Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression into relationship between more than two variables. In simple linear relation we have one predictor and one response variable, but in multiple regression we have more than one predictor variable and one response variable.</p>

<title>R Logistic Regression</title>

<h1>R - Logistic Regression</h1>

<p>The Logistic Regression is a regression model in which the response variable (dependent variable) has categorical values such as True/False or 0/1. It actually measures the probability of a binary response as the value of response variable based on the mathematical equation relating it with the predictor variables.</p>

<p>The general mathematical equation for logistic regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>y</b> is the response variable.</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the predictor variable.</p>

<p><b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the coefficients which are numeric constants.</p>

<p>The function used to create the regression model is the <b>glm()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for <b>glm()</b> function in logistic regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is the symbol presenting the relationship between the variables.</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the data set giving the values of these variables.</p>

<p><b>family</b> is R object to specify the details of the model. It's value is binomial for logistic regression.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The in-built data set "mtcars" describes different models of a car with their various engine specifications. In "mtcars" data set, the transmission mode (automatic or manual) is described by the column am which is a binary value (0 or 1). We can create a logistic regression model between the columns "am" and 3 other columns - hp, wt and cyl.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Create Regression Model</h2>

<p>We use the <b>glm()</b> function to create the regression model and get its summary for analysis.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the summary as the p-value in the last column is more than 0.05 for the variables "cyl" and "hp", we consider them to be insignificant in contributing to the value of the variable "am". Only weight (wt) impacts the "am" value in this regression model.</p>

<title>R Normal Distribution</title>

<h1>R - Normal Distribution</h1>

<p>In a random collection of data from independent sources, it is generally observed that the distribution of data is normal. Which means, on plotting a graph with the value of the variable in the horizontal axis and the count of the values in the vertical axis we get a bell shape curve. The center of the curve represents the mean of the data set. In the graph, fifty percent of values lie to the left of the mean and the other fifty percent lie to the right of the graph. This is referred as normal distribution in statistics.</p>

<p>R has four in built functions to generate normal distribution. They are described below.</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used in above functions &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is a vector of numbers.</p>

<p><b>p</b> is a vector of probabilities.</p>

<p><b>n</b> is number of observations(sample size).</p>

<p><b>mean</b> is the mean value of the sample data. It's default value is zero.</p>

<p><b>sd</b> is the standard deviation. It's default value is 1.</p>

<h2>dnorm()</h2>

<p>This function gives height of the probability distribution at each point for a given mean and standard deviation.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>pnorm()</h2>

<p>This function gives the probability of a normally distributed random number to be less that the value of a given number. It is also called "Cumulative Distribution Function".</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>qnorm()</h2>

<p>This function takes the probability value and gives a number whose cumulative value matches the probability value.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>rnorm()</h2>

<p>This function is used to generate random numbers whose distribution is normal. It takes the sample size as input and generates that many random numbers. We draw a histogram to show the distribution of the generated numbers.</p>

<title>R Analysis of Covariance</title>

<h1>R - Analysis of Covariance</h1>

<p>We use Regression analysis to create models which describe the effect of variation in predictor variables on the response variable. Sometimes, if we have a categorical variable with values like Yes/No or Male/Female etc. The simple regression analysis gives multiple results for each value of the categorical variable. In such scenario, we can study the effect of the categorical variable by using it along with the predictor variable and comparing the regression lines for each level of the categorical variable. Such an analysis is termed as <b>Analysis of Covariance</b> also called as <b>ANCOVA</b>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Consider the R built in data set mtcars. In it we observer that the field "am" represents the type of transmission (auto or manual). It is a categorical variable with values 0 and 1. The miles per gallon value(mpg) of a car can also depend on it besides the value of horse power("hp").</p>

<p>We study the effect of the value of "am" on the regression between "mpg" and "hp". It is done by using the <b>aov()</b> function followed by the <b>anova()</b> function to compare the multiple regressions.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>Create a data frame containing the fields "mpg", "hp" and "am" from the data set mtcars. Here we take "mpg" as the response variable, "hp" as the predictor variable and "am" as the categorical variable.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>ANCOVA Analysis</h2>

<p>We create a regression model taking "hp" as the predictor variable and "mpg" as the response variable taking into account the interaction between "am" and "hp".</p>

<h3>Model with interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result shows that both horse power and transmission type has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value in both cases is less than 0.05. But the interaction between these two variables is not significant as the p-value is more than 0.05.</p>

<h3>Model without interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result shows that both horse power and transmission type has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value in both cases is less than 0.05.</p>

<h2>Comparing Two Models</h2>

<p>Now we can compare the two models to conclude if the interaction of the variables is truly in-significant. For this we use the <b>anova()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>As the p-value is greater than 0.05 we conclude that the interaction between horse power and transmission type is not significant. So the mileage per gallon will depend in a similar manner on the horse power of the car in both auto and manual transmission mode.</p>

<title>R Time Series Analysis</title>

<h1>R - Time Series Analysis</h1>

<p>Time series is a series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp. A simple example is the price of a stock in the stock market at different points of time on a given day. Another example is the amount of rainfall in a region at different months of the year. R language uses many functions to create, manipulate and plot the time series data. The data for the time series is stored in an R object called <b>time-series object</b>. It is also a R data object like a vector or data frame.</p>

<p>The time series object is created by using the <b>ts()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for <b>ts()</b> function in time series analysis is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>data</b> is a vector or matrix containing the values used in the time series.</p>

<p><b>start</b> specifies the start time for the first observation in time series.</p>

<p><b>end</b> specifies the end time for the last observation in time series.</p>

<p><b>frequency</b> specifies the number of observations per unit time.</p>

<p>Except the parameter "data" all other parameters are optional.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Consider the annual rainfall details at a place starting from January 2012. We create an R time series object for a period of 12 months and plot it.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>The Time series chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Different Time Intervals</h2>

<p>The value of the <b>frequency</b> parameter in the ts() function decides the time intervals at which the data points are measured. A value of 12 indicates that the time series is for 12 months. Other values and its meaning is as below &minus;</p>

<p><b>frequency = 12</b> pegs the data points for every month of a year.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 4</b> pegs the data points for every quarter of a year.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 6</b> pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of an hour.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 24*6</b> pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of a day.</p>

<h2>Multiple Time Series</h2>

<p>We can plot multiple time series in one chart by combining both the series into a matrix.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<title>R Nonlinear Least Square</title>

<h1>R - Nonlinear Least Square</h1>

<p>When modeling real world data for regression analysis, we observe that it is rarely the case that the equation of the model is a linear equation giving a linear graph. Most of the time, the equation of the model of real world data involves mathematical functions of higher degree like an exponent of 3 or a sin function. In such a scenario, the plot of the model gives a curve rather than a line. The goal of both linear and non-linear regression is to adjust the values of the model's parameters to find the line or curve that comes closest to your data. On finding these values we will be able to estimate the response variable with good accuracy.</p>

<p>In Least Square regression, we establish a regression model in which the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of different points from the regression curve is minimized. We generally start with a defined model and assume some values for the coefficients. We then apply the <b>nls()</b> function of R to get the more accurate values along with the confidence intervals.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a nonlinear least square test in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is a nonlinear model formula including variables and parameters.</p>

<p><b>data</b> is a data frame used to evaluate the variables in the formula.</p>

<p><b>start</b> is a named list or named numeric vector of starting estimates.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will consider a nonlinear model with assumption of initial values of its coefficients. Next we will see what is the confidence intervals of these assumed values so that we can judge how well these values fir into the model.</p>

<p>So let's consider the below equation for this purpose &minus;</p>

<p>Let's assume the initial coefficients to be 1 and 3 and fit these values into nls() function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can conclude that the value of b1 is more close to 1 while the value of b2 is more close to 2 and not 3.</p>

<title>R Decision Tree</title>

<h1>R - Decision Tree</h1>

<p>Decision tree is a graph to represent choices and their results in form of a tree. The nodes in the graph represent an event or choice and the edges of the graph represent the decision rules or conditions. It is mostly used in Machine Learning and Data Mining applications using R.</p>

<p>Examples of use of decision tress is &minus; predicting an email as spam or not spam, predicting of a tumor is cancerous or predicting a loan as a good or bad credit risk based on the factors in each of these. Generally, a model is created with observed data also called training data. Then a set of validation data is used to verify and improve the model. R has packages which are used to create and visualize decision trees. For new set of predictor variable, we use this model to arrive at a decision on the category (yes/No, spam/not spam) of the data.</p>

<p>The R package <b>"party"</b> is used to create decision trees.</p>

<h2>Install R Package</h2>

<p>Use the below command in R console to install the package. You also have to install the dependent packages if any.</p>

<p>The package "party" has the function <b>ctree()</b> which is used to create and analyze decison tree.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is a formula describing the predictor and response variables.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>We will use the R in-built data set named <b>readingSkills</b> to create a decision tree. It describes the score of someone's readingSkills if we know the variables "age","shoesize","score" and whether the person is a native speaker or not.</p>

<p>Here is the sample data.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will use the <b>ctree()</b> function to create the decision tree and see its graph.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>From the decision tree shown above we can conclude that anyone whose readingSkills score is less than 38.3 and age is more than 6 is not a native Speaker.</p>

<title>R Random Forest</title>

<h1>R - Random Forest</h1>

<p>In the random forest approach, a large number of decision trees are created. Every observation is fed into every decision tree. The most common outcome for each observation is used as the final output. A new observation is fed into all the trees and taking a majority vote for each classification model.</p>

<p>An error estimate is made for the cases which were not used while building the tree. That is called an <b>OOB (Out-of-bag)</b> error estimate which is mentioned as a percentage.</p>

<p>The R package <b>"randomForest"</b> is used to create random forests.</p>

<h2>Install R Package</h2>

<p>Use the below command in R console to install the package. You also have to install the dependent packages if any.</p>

<p>The package "randomForest" has the function <b>randomForest()</b> which is used to create and analyze random forests.</p>

<title>R Survival Analysis</title>

<h1>R - Survival Analysis</h1>

<p>Survival analysis deals with predicting the time when a specific event is going to occur. It is also known as failure time analysis or analysis of time to death. For example predicting the number of days a person with cancer will survive or predicting the time when a mechanical system is going to fail.</p>

<p>The R package named <b>survival</b> is used to carry out survival analysis. This package contains the function <b>Surv()</b> which takes the input data as a R formula and creates a survival object among the chosen variables for analysis. Then we use the function <b>survfit()</b> to create a plot for the analysis.</p>

<h2>Install Package</h2>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The basic syntax for creating survival analysis in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>time</b> is the follow up time until the event occurs.</p>

<p><b>event</b> indicates the status of occurrence of the expected event.</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is the relationship between the predictor variables.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We will consider the data set named "pbc" present in the survival packages installed above. It describes the survival data points about people affected with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. Among the many columns present in the data set we are primarily concerned with the fields "time" and "status". Time represents the number of days between registration of the patient and earlier of the event between the patient receiving a liver transplant or death of the patient.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>From the above data we are considering time and status for our analysis.</p>

<h3>Applying Surv() and survfit() Function</h3>

<p>Now we proceed to apply the <b>Surv()</b> function to the above data set and create a plot that will show the trend.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>The trend in the above graph helps us predicting the probability of survival at the end of a certain number of days.</p>

Time represents the number of days between registration of the patient and earlier of the event between the patient receiving a liver transplant or death of the patient.</p>

<title>R Chi Square Test</title>

<h1>R - Chi Square Test</h1>

<p><b>Chi-Square test</b> is a statistical method to determine if two categorical variables have a significant correlation between them. Both those variables should be from same population and they should be categorical like &minus; Yes/No, Male/Female, Red/Green etc.</p>

<p>For example, we can build a data set with observations on people's ice-cream buying pattern and try to correlate the gender of a person with the flavor of the ice-cream they prefer. If a correlation is found we can plan for appropriate stock of flavors by knowing the number of gender of people visiting.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The function used for performing chi-Square test is <b>chisq.test()</b>.</p>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a chi-square test in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the data in form of a table containing the count value of the variables in the observation.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will take the Cars93 data in the "MASS" library which represents the sales of different models of car in the year 1993.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The above result shows the dataset has many Factor variables which can be considered as categorical variables. For our model we will consider the variables "AirBags" and "Type". Here we aim to find out any significant correlation between the types of car sold and the type of Air bags it has. If correlation is observed we can estimate which types of cars can sell better with what types of air bags.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The result shows the p-value of less than 0.05 which indicates a string correlation.</p>

<title>R Interview Questions</title>

<h1>R - Interview Questions</h1>

<p>Dear readers, these R Interview Questions have been designed specially to get you acquainted with the nature of questions you may encounter during your interview for the subject of R programming. As per my experience good interviewers hardly plan to ask any particular question during your interview, normally questions start with some basic concept of the subject and later they continue based on further discussion and what you answer &minus;</p>

<p>R is a programming language meant for statistical analysis and creating graphs for this purpose.Instead of data types, it has data objects which are used for calculations. It is used in the fields of data mining, Regression analysis, Probability estimation etc., using many packages available in it.</p>

<p>There are 6 data objects in R. They are vectors, lists, arrays, matrices, data frames and tables.</p>

<p>A matrix is always two dimensional as it has only rows and columns. But an array can be of any number of dimensions and each dimension is a matrix. For example a 3x3x2 array represents 2 matrices each of dimension 3x3.</p>

<p>The Factor data objects in R are used to store and process categorical data in R.</p>

<p>A csv file can be loaded using the read.csv function. R creates a data frame on reading the csv files using this function.</p>

<p>The command getwd() gives the current working directory in the R environment.</p>

<p>This is the package which is loaded by default when R environment is set. It provides the basic functionalities like input/output, arithmetic calculations etc. in the R environment.</p>

<p>Logistic regression deals with measuring the probability of a binary response variable. In R the function glm() is used to create the logistic regression.</p>

<p>The expression M[4,2] gives the element at 4th row and 2nd column.</p>

<p>When two vectors of different length are involved in a operation then the elements of the shorter vector are reused to complete the operation. This is called element recycling. Example - v1 &lt;- c(4,1,0,6) and V2 &lt;- c(2,4) then v1*v2 gives (8,4,0,24). The elements 2 and 4 are repeated.</p>

<p>We can call a function in R in 3 ways. First method is to call by using position of the arguments. Second method id to call by using the name of the arguments and the third method is to call by default arguments.</p>

<p>The lazy evaluation of a function means, the argument is evaluated only if it is used inside the body of the function. If there is no reference to the argument in the body of the function then it is simply ignored.</p>

<p>To install a package in R we use the below command.</p>

<p>The package named "XML" is used to read and process the XML files.</p>

<p>We can update any of the element but we can delete only the element at the end of the list.</p>

<p>The general expression to create a matrix in R is - matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow, dimnames)</p>

<p>The boxplot() function is used to create boxplots in R. It takes a formula and a data frame as inputs to create the boxplots.</p>

<p> Frequency  6 indicates the time interval for the time series data is every 10 minutes of an hour.</p>

<p>In R the data objects can be converted from one form to another. For example we can create a data frame by merging many lists. This involves a series of R commands to bring the data into the new format. This is called data reshaping.</p>

<p>It generates 4 random numbers between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>Use the command</p>

<p>It splits the strings in vector x into substrings at the position of letter e.</p>

<p>Error in v * x[1] : non-numeric argument to binary operator</p>

<p>[1]  5 12 21 32s</p>

<p>It converts a list to a vector.</p>

<p>NA</p>

<p>Using the function as.data.frame()</p>

<p>It is used to apply the same function to each of the elements in an Array. For example finding the mean of the rows in every row.</p>

<p>Every matrix can be called an array but not the reverse. Matrix is always two dimensional but array can be of any dimension.</p>

<p> ?NA</p>

<p>sd(x, na.rm=TRUE)</p>

<p>setwd("Path")</p>

<p>"%%" gives remainder of the division of first vector with second while "%/%" gives the quotient of the division of first vector with second.</p>

<p>Find the column has the maximum value for each row.</p>

<p>hist()</p>

<p>rm(x)</p>

<p>data(package = "MASS")</p>

<p>It is used to install a r package from local directory by browsing and selecting the file.</p>

<p>Where formula represents the series of variables used in pairs and data represents the data set from which the variables will be taken.</p>

<p>The subset() functions is used to select variables and observations. The sample() function is used to choose a random sample of size n from a dataset.</p>

<p>is.matrix(m)  should retrun TRUE.</p>

<p>[1] NA</p>

<p>The function t() is used for transposing a matrix. Example - t(m) , where m is a matrix.</p>

<p>The "next" statement in R programming language is useful when we want to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it.</p>

<h1>R - Overview</h1>

<p>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team.</p>

<p>The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. R allows integration with the procedures written in the C, C&plus;&plus;, .Net, Python or FORTRAN languages for efficiency.</p>

<p>R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copy left, and an official part of the GNU project called <b>GNU S</b>.</p>

<h2>Evolution of R</h2>

<p>R was initially written by <b>Ross Ihaka</b> and <b>Robert Gentleman</b> at the Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. R made its first appearance in 1993.</p>

<p>A large group of individuals has contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.</p>

<p>Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the "R Core Team") who can modify the R source code archive.</p>

<h2>Features of R</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. The following are the important features of R &minus;</p>

<p>R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.</p>

<p>R has an effective data handling and storage facility,</p>

<p>R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.</p>

<p>R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, R is world’s most widely used statistics programming language. It's the # 1 choice of data scientists and supported by a vibrant and talented community of contributors. R is taught in universities and deployed in mission critical business applications. This tutorial will teach you R programming along with suitable examples in simple and easy steps.</p>

<h1>R - Environment Setup</h1>

<h2>Try it Option Online</h2>

<p>You really do not need to set up your own environment to start learning R programming language. Reason is very simple, we already have set up R Programming environment online, so that you can compile and execute all the available examples online at the same time when you are doing your theory work. This gives you confidence in what you are reading and to check the result with different options. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

<p>Try the following example using <b>Try it</b> option at the website available at the top right corner of the below sample code box &minus;</p>

<p>For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find <b>Try it</b> option at the website, so just make use of it and enjoy your learning.</p>

<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>

<p>If you are still willing to set up your environment for R, you can follow the steps given below.</p>

<h3>Windows Installation</h3>

<p>You can download the Windows installer version of R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R-3.2.2 for Windows (32/64 bit)</a> and save it in a local directory.</p>

<p>As it is a Windows installer (.exe) with a name "R-version-win.exe". You can just double click and run the installer accepting the default settings. If your Windows is 32-bit version, it installs the 32-bit version. But if your windows is 64-bit, then it installs both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>

<p>After installation you can locate the icon to run the Program in a directory structure "R\R3.2.2\bin\i386\Rgui.exe" under the Windows Program Files. Clicking this icon brings up the R-GUI which is the R console to do R Programming.</p>

<h3>Linux Installation</h3>

<p>R is available as a binary for many versions of Linux at the location <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Binaries</a>.</p>

<p>The instruction to install Linux varies from flavor to flavor. These steps are mentioned under each type of Linux version in the mentioned link. However, if you are in a hurry, then you can use <b>yum</b> command to install R as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Above command will install core functionality of R programming along with standard packages, still you need additional package, then you can launch R prompt as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Now you can use install command at R prompt to install the required package. For example, the following command will install <b>plotrix</b> package which is required for 3D charts.</p>

<h1>R - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>As a convention, we will start learning R programming by writing a "Hello, World!" program. Depending on the needs, you can program either at R command prompt or you can use an R script file to write your program. Let's check both one by one.</p>

<h2>R Command Prompt</h2>

<p>Once you have R environment setup, then it’s easy to start your R command prompt by just typing the following command at your command prompt &minus;</p>

<p>This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt &gt; where you can start typing your program as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Here first statement defines a string variable myString, where we assign a string "Hello, World!" and then next statement print() is being used to print the value stored in variable myString.</p>

<h2>R Script File</h2>

<p>Usually, you will do your programming by writing your programs in script files and then you execute those scripts at your command prompt with the help of R interpreter called <b>Rscript</b>. So let's start with writing following code in a text file called test.R as under &minus;</p>

<p>Save the above code in a file test.R and execute it at Linux command prompt as given below. Even if you are using Windows or other system, syntax will remain same.</p>

<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows &minus;</p>

<p>R does not support multi-line comments but you can perform a trick which is something as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Though above comments will be executed by R interpreter, they will not interfere with your actual program. You should put such comments inside, either single or double quote.</p>

<h1>R - Data Types</h1>

<p>Generally, while doing programming in any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that, when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>

<p>You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, Boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>

<p>In contrast to other programming languages like C and java in R, the variables are not declared as some data type. The variables are assigned with R-Objects and the data type of the R-object becomes the data type of the variable. There are many types of R-objects. The frequently used ones are &minus;</p>

<p>The simplest of these objects is the <b>vector object</b> and there are six data types of these atomic vectors, also termed as six classes of vectors. The other R-Objects are built upon the atomic vectors.</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In R programming, the very basic data types are the R-objects called <b>vectors</b> which hold elements of different classes as shown above. Please note in R the number of classes is not confined to only the above six types. For example, we can use many atomic vectors and create an array whose class will become array.</p>

<h2>Vectors</h2>

<p>When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use <b>c()</b> function which means to combine the elements into a vector.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, functions and even another list inside it.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Matrices</h2>

<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Arrays</h2>

<p>While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension. In the below example we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Factors</h2>

<p>Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.</p>

<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor()</b> function.The <b>nlevels</b> functions gives the count of levels.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Frames</h2>

<p>Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list of vectors of equal length.</p>

<p>Data Frames are created using the <b>data.frame()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Variables</h1>

<p>A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. A variable in R can store an atomic vector, group of atomic vectors or a combination of many Robjects. A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number.</p>

<h2>Variable Assignment</h2>

<p>The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values of the variables can be printed using <b>print()</b> or <b>cat()</b>function. The <b>cat()</b> function combines multiple items into a continuous print output.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The vector c(TRUE,1) has a mix of logical and numeric class. So logical class is coerced to numeric class making TRUE as 1.</p>

<h2>Data Type of a Variable</h2>

<p>In R, a variable itself is not declared of any data type, rather it gets the data type of the R - object assigned to it. So R is called a dynamically typed language, which means that we can change a variable’s data type of the same variable again and again when using it in a program.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Finding Variables</h2>

<p>To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the <b>ls()</b> function. Also the ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; It is a sample output depending on what variables are declared in your environment.</p>

<p>The ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The variables starting with <b>dot(.)</b> are hidden, they can be listed using "all.names = TRUE" argument to ls() function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Deleting Variables</h2>

<p>Variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> function. Below we delete the variable var.3. On printing the value of the variable error is thrown.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>All the variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> and <b>ls()</b> function together.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Operators</h1>

<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. R language is rich in built-in operators and provides following types of operators.</p>

<h2>Types of Operators</h2>

<h1>R - Decision making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require the programmer to specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>R provides the following types of decision making statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional <b>else</b> statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p>

<p>A <b>switch</b> statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values.</p>

<h1>R - Loops</h1>

<p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially. The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>R programming language provides the following kinds of loop to handle looping requirements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>

<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

<p>Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>R supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>

<p>Terminates the <b>loop</b> statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>

<p>The <b>next</b> statement simulates the behavior of R switch.</p>

<h1>R - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions.</p>

<p>In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments that may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions.</p>

<p>The function in turn performs its task and returns control to the interpreter as well as any result which may be stored in other objects.</p>

<h2>Function Definition</h2>

<p>An R function is created by using the keyword <b>function</b>. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Function Components </h2>

<p>The different parts of a function are &minus;</p>

<p><b>Function Name</b> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.</p>

<p><b>Arguments</b> &minus; An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.</p>

<p><b>Function Body</b> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.</p>

<p>R has many <b>in-built</b> functions which can be directly called in the program without defining them first. We can also create and use our own functions referred as <b>user defined</b> functions.</p>

<h2>Built-in Function</h2>

<p>Simple examples of in-built functions are <b>seq()</b>, <b>mean()</b>, <b>max()</b>, <b>sum(x)</b> and <b>paste(...)</b> etc. They are directly called by user written programs. You can refer <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most widely used R functions.</a></p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>User-defined Function</h2>

<h3>Calling a Function with Default Argument</h3>

<p>We can define the value of the arguments in the function definition and call the function without supplying any argument to get the default result. But we can also call such functions by supplying new values of the argument and get non default result.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Lazy Evaluation of Function</h3>

<p>Arguments to functions are evaluated lazily, which means so they are evaluated only when needed by the function body.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Strings</h1>

<p>Any value written within a pair of single quote or double quotes in R is treated as a string. Internally R stores every string within double quotes, even when you create them with single quote.</p>

<h2>Rules Applied in String Construction</h2>

<p>The quotes at the beginning and end of a string should be both double quotes or both single quote. They can not be mixed.</p>

<p>Double quotes can be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p>

<p>Single quote can be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p>

<p>Double quotes can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p>

<p>Single quote can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p>

<h3>Examples of Valid Strings</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Packages</h1>

<p>R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory called <b>"library"</b> in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them.</p>

<p>All the packages available in R language are listed at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Packages.</a></p>

<p>Below is a list of commands to be used to check, verify and use the R packages.</p>

<h2>Check Available R Packages</h2>

<p>Get library locations containing R packages</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<h2>Get the list of all the packages installed</h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<p>Get all packages currently loaded in the R environment</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>

<h2>Install a New Package</h2>

<p>There are two ways to add new R packages. One is installing directly from the CRAN directory and another is downloading the package to your local system and installing it manually.</p>

<h3>Install directly from CRAN</h3>

<p>The following command gets the packages directly from CRAN webpage and installs the package in the R environment. You may be prompted to choose a nearest mirror. Choose the one appropriate to your location.</p>

<h3>Install package manually</h3>

<p>Go to the link <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">R Packages</a> to download the package needed. Save the package as a <b>.zip</b> file in a suitable location in the local system.</p>

<p>Now you can run the following command to install this package in the R environment.</p>

<h2>Load Package to Library</h2>

<p>Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment. You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available in the current environment.</p>

<p>A package is loaded using the following command &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Data Reshaping</h1>

<p>Data Reshaping in R is about changing the way data is organized into rows and columns. Most of the time data processing in R is done by taking the input data as a data frame. It is easy to extract data from the rows and columns of a data frame but there are situations when we need the data frame in a format that is different from format in which we received it. R has many functions to split, merge and change the rows to columns and vice-versa in a data frame.</p>

<h2>Joining Columns and Rows in a Data Frame</h2>

<p>We can join multiple vectors to create a data frame using the <b>cbind()</b>function. Also we can merge two data frames using <b>rbind()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Merging Data Frames</h2>

<p>We can merge two data frames by using the <b>merge()</b> function. The data frames must have same column names on which the merging happens.</p>

<p>In the example below, we consider the data sets about Diabetes in Pima Indian Women available in the library names "MASS". we merge the two data sets based on the values of blood pressure("bp") and body mass index("bmi"). On choosing these two columns for merging, the records where values of these two variables match in both data sets are combined together to form a single data frame.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Melting and Casting</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of R programming is about changing the shape of the data in multiple steps to get a desired shape. The functions used to do this are called <b>melt()</b> and <b>cast()</b>.</p>

<p>We consider the dataset called ships present in the library called "MASS".</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Melt the Data</h2>

<p>Now we melt the data to organize it, converting all columns other than type and year into multiple rows.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Cast the Molten Data</h2>

<p>We can cast the molten data into a new form where the aggregate of each type of ship for each year is created. It is done using the <b>cast()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - CSV Files</h1>

<p>In R, we can read data from files stored outside the R environment. We can also write data into files which will be stored and accessed by the operating system. R can read and write into various file formats like csv, excel, xml etc.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will learn to read data from a csv file and then write data into a csv file. The file should be present in current working directory so that R can read it. Of course we can also set our own directory and read files from there.</p>

<h2>Getting and Setting the Working Directory</h2>

<p>You can check which directory the R workspace is pointing to using the <b>getwd()</b> function. You can also set a new working directory using <b>setwd()</b>function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result depends on your OS and your current directory where you are working.</p>

<h2>Input as CSV File</h2>

<p>The csv file is a text file in which the values in the columns are separated by a comma. Let's consider the following data present in the file named <b>input.csv</b>.</p>

<p>You can create this file using windows notepad by copying and pasting this data. Save the file as <b>input.csv</b> using the save As All files(*.*) option in notepad.</p>

<h2>Reading a CSV File</h2>

<p>Following is a simple example of <b>read.csv()</b> function to read a CSV file available in your current working directory &minus;</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Analyzing the CSV File</h2>

<p>By default the <b>read.csv()</b> function gives the output as a data frame. This can be easily checked as follows. Also we can check the number of columns and rows.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Once we read data in a data frame, we can apply all the functions applicable to data frames as explained in subsequent section.</p>

<h3>Get the maximum salary</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get the details of the person with max salary</h3>

<p>Here the column X comes from the data set newper. This can be dropped using additional parameters while writing the file.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Excel File</h1>

<p>Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program which stores data in the .xls or .xlsx format. R can read directly from these files using some excel specific packages. Few such packages are - XLConnect, xlsx, gdata etc. We will be using xlsx package. R can also write into excel file using this package.</p>

<h2>Install xlsx Package</h2>

<p>You can use the following command in the R console to install the "xlsx" package. It may ask to install some additional packages on which this package is dependent. Follow the same command with required package name to install the additional packages.</p>

<h2>Verify and Load the "xlsx" Package</h2>

<p>Use the following command to verify and load the "xlsx" package.</p>

<p>When the script is run we get the following output.</p>

<h2>Input as xlsx File</h2>

<p>Open Microsoft excel. Copy and paste the following data in the work sheet named as sheet1.</p>

<p>Also copy and paste the following data to another worksheet and rename this worksheet to "city".</p>

<p>Save the Excel file as "input.xlsx". You should save it in the current working directory of the R workspace.</p>

<h2>Reading the Excel File</h2>

<p>The input.xlsx is read by using the <b>read.xlsx()</b> function as shown below. The result is stored as a data frame in the R environment.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Binary Files</h1>

<p>A binary file is a file that contains information stored only in form of bits and bytes.(0’s and 1’s). They are not human readable as the bytes in it translate to characters and symbols which contain many other non-printable characters. Attempting to read a binary file using any text editor will show characters like &Oslash; and &eth;.</p>

<p>The binary file has to be read by specific programs to be useable. For example, the binary file of a Microsoft Word program can be read to a human readable form only by the Word program. Which indicates that, besides the human readable text, there is a lot more information like formatting of characters and page numbers etc., which are also stored along with alphanumeric characters. And finally a binary file is a continuous sequence of bytes. The line break we see in a text file is a character joining first line to the next.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the data generated by other programs are required to be processed by R as a binary file. Also R is required to create binary files which can be shared with other programs.</p>

<p>R has two functions <b>WriteBin()</b> and <b>readBin()</b> to create and read binary files.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>con</b> is the connection object to read or write the binary file.</p>

<p><b>object</b> is the binary file which to be written.</p>

<p><b>what</b> is the mode like character, integer etc. representing the bytes to be read.</p>

<p><b>n</b> is the number of bytes to read from the binary file.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We consider the R inbuilt data "mtcars". First we create a csv file from it and convert it to a binary file and store it as a OS file. Next we read this binary file created into R.</p>

<h2>Writing the Binary File</h2>

<p>We read the data frame "mtcars" as a csv file and then write it as a binary file to the OS.</p>

<h2>Reading the Binary File</h2>

<p>The binary file created above stores all the data as continuous bytes. So we will read it by choosing appropriate values of column names as well as the column values.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>As we can see, we got the original data back by reading the binary file in R.</p>

<h1>R - XML Files</h1>

<p>XML is a file format which shares both the file format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. It stands for Extensible Markup Language (XML). Similar to HTML it contains markup tags. But unlike HTML where the markup tag describes structure of the page, in xml the markup tags describe the meaning of the data contained into he file.</p>

<p>You can read a xml file in R using the "XML" package. This package can be installed using following command.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>Create a XMl file by copying the below data into a text editor like notepad. Save the file with a <b>.xml</b> extension and choosing the file type as <b>all files(*.*)</b>.</p>

<h2>Reading XML File</h2>

<p>The xml file is read by R using the function <b>xmlParse()</b>. It is stored as a list in R.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Get Number of Nodes Present in XML File</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Web Data</h1>

<p>Many websites provide data for consumption by its users. For example the World Health Organization(WHO) provides reports on health and medical information in the form of CSV, txt and XML files. Using R programs, we can programmatically extract specific data from such websites. Some packages in R which are used to scrap data form the web are &minus; "RCurl",XML", and "stringr". They are used to connect to the URL’s, identify required links for the files and download them to the local environment.</p>

<h2>Install R Packages</h2>

<p>The following packages are required for processing the URL’s and links to the files. If they are not available in your R Environment, you can install them using following commands.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>We will visit the URL <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">weather data</a> and download the CSV files using R for the year 2015.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will use the function <b>getHTMLLinks()</b> to gather the URLs of the files. Then we will use the function <b>downlaod.file()</b> to save the files to the local system. As we will be applying the same code again and again for multiple files, we will create a function to be called multiple times. The filenames are passed as parameters in form of a R list object to this function.</p>

<h2>Verify the File Download</h2>

<p>After running the above code, you can locate the following files in the current R working directory.</p>

<h1>R - Databases</h1>

<p>The data is Relational database systems are stored in a normalized format. So, to carry out statistical computing we will need very advanced and complex Sql queries. But R can connect easily to many relational databases like MySql, Oracle, Sql server etc. and fetch records from them as a data frame. Once the data is available in the R environment, it becomes a normal R data set and can be manipulated or analyzed using all the powerful packages and functions.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will be using MySql as our reference database for connecting to R.</p>

<p><b>axes</b> indicates whether both axes should be drawn on the plot.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We use the data set <b>"mtcars"</b> available in the R environment to create a basic scatterplot. Let's use the columns "wt" and "mpg" in mtcars.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The below script will create a scatterplot graph for the relation between wt(weight) and mpg(miles per gallon).</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Scatterplot Matrices</h2>

<p>When we have more than two variables and we want to find the correlation between one variable versus the remaining ones we use scatterplot matrix. We use <b>pairs()</b> function to create matrices of scatterplots.</p>

<p>The basic syntax for creating scatterplot matrices in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> represents the series of variables used in pairs.</p>

<h1>R - Mean, Median &amp; Mode</h1>

<p>Statistical analysis in R is performed by using many in-built functions. Most of these functions are part of the R base package. These functions take R vector as an input along with the arguments and give the result.</p>

<p>The functions we are discussing in this chapter are mean, median and mode.</p>

<h2>Mean</h2>

<p>It is calculated by taking the sum of the values and dividing with the number of values in a data series.</p>

<p>The function <b>mean()</b> is used to calculate this in R.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The basic syntax for calculating mean in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the input vector.</p>

<p><b>trim</b> is used to drop some observations from both end of the sorted vector.</p>

<p><b>na.rm</b> is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Applying Trim Option</h2>

<p>When trim parameter is supplied, the values in the vector get sorted and then the required numbers of observations are dropped from calculating the mean.</p>

<p>When trim = 0.3, 3 values from each end will be dropped from the calculations to find mean.</p>

<p>In this case the sorted vector is (&minus;21, &minus;5, 2, 3, 4.2, 7, 8, 12, 18, 54) and the values removed from the vector for calculating mean are (&minus;21,&minus;5,2) from left and (12,18,54) from right.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Applying NA Option</h2>

<p>If there are missing values, then the mean function returns NA.</p>

<p>To drop the missing values from the calculation use na.rm = TRUE. which means remove the NA values.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Median</h2>

<p>The middle most value in a data series is called the median. The <b>median()</b> function is used in R to calculate this value.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The basic syntax for calculating median in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the input vector.</p>

<p><b>na.rm</b> is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Mode</h2>

<p>The mode is the value that has highest number of occurrences in a set of data. Unike mean and median, mode can have both numeric and character data.</p>

<p>R does not have a standard in-built function to calculate mode. So we create a user function to calculate mode of a data set in R. This function takes the vector as input and gives the mode value as output.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Linear Regression</h1>

<p>Regression analysis is a very widely used statistical tool to establish a relationship model between two variables. One of these variable is called predictor variable whose value is gathered through experiments. The other variable is called response variable whose value is derived from the predictor variable.</p>

<p>In Linear Regression these two variables are related through an equation, where exponent (power) of both these variables is 1. Mathematically a linear relationship represents a straight line when plotted as a graph. A non-linear relationship where the exponent of any variable is not equal to 1 creates a curve.</p>

<p>Consider the data set "mtcars" available in the R environment. It gives a comparison between different car models in terms of mileage per gallon (mpg), cylinder displacement("disp"), horse power("hp"), weight of the car("wt") and some more parameters.</p>

<p>The goal of the model is to establish the relationship between "mpg" as a response variable with "disp","hp" and "wt" as predictor variables. We create a subset of these variables from the mtcars data set for this purpose.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Create Relationship Model &amp; get the Coefficients</h3>

<p>For a car with disp = 221, hp = 102 and wt = 2.91 the predicted mileage is &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Logistic Regression</h1>

<p>The Logistic Regression is a regression model in which the response variable (dependent variable) has categorical values such as True/False or 0/1. It actually measures the probability of a binary response as the value of response variable based on the mathematical equation relating it with the predictor variables.</p>

<p>The general mathematical equation for logistic regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>y</b> is the response variable.</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the predictor variable.</p>

In "mtcars" data set, the transmission mode (automatic or manual) is described by the column am which is a binary value (0 or 1). We can create a logistic regression model between the columns "am" and 3 other columns - hp, wt and cyl.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Create Regression Model</h2>

<p>We use the <b>glm()</b> function to create the regression model and get its summary for analysis.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the summary as the p-value in the last column is more than 0.05 for the variables "cyl" and "hp", we consider them to be insignificant in contributing to the value of the variable "am". Only weight (wt) impacts the "am" value in this regression model.</p>

<h1>R - Normal Distribution</h1>

<p>In a random collection of data from independent sources, it is generally observed that the distribution of data is normal. Which means, on plotting a graph with the value of the variable in the horizontal axis and the count of the values in the vertical axis we get a bell shape curve. The center of the curve represents the mean of the data set. In the graph, fifty percent of values lie to the left of the mean and the other fifty percent lie to the right of the graph. This is referred as normal distribution in statistics.</p>

<p>R has four in built functions to generate normal distribution. They are described below.</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used in above functions &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is a vector of numbers.</p>

<p><b>p</b> is a vector of probabilities.</p>

<p><b>n</b> is number of observations(sample size).</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Binomial Distribution</h1>

<p>The binomial distribution model deals with finding the probability of success of an event which has only two possible outcomes in a series of experiments. For example, tossing of a coin always gives a head or a tail. The probability of finding exactly 3 heads in tossing a coin repeatedly for 10 times is estimated during the binomial distribution.</p>

<p>R has four in-built functions to generate binomial distribution. They are described below.</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>x</b> is a vector of numbers.</p>

<p><b>p</b> is a vector of probabilities.</p>

<p><b>n</b> is number of observations.</p>

<p><b>prob</b> is the probability of success of each trial.</p>

<h2>dbinom()</h2>

<p>This function gives the probability density distribution at each point.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>pbinom()</h2>

<p>This function gives the cumulative probability of an event. It is a single value representing the probability.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>qbinom()</h2>

<p>This function takes the probability value and gives a number whose cumulative value matches the probability value.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>rbinom()</h2>

<p>This function generates required number of random values of given probability from a given sample.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Poisson Regression</h1>

<p>Poisson Regression involves regression models in which the response variable is in the form of counts and not fractional numbers. For example, the count of number of births or number of wins in a football match series. Also the values of the response variables follow a Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>The general mathematical equation for Poisson regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>y</b> is the response variable.</p>

<p><b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the numeric coefficients.</p>

<p><b>x</b> is the predictor variable.</p>

<p>The function used to create the Poisson regression model is the <b>glm()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for <b>glm()</b> function in Poisson regression is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used in above functions &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is the symbol presenting the relationship between the variables.</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the data set giving the values of these variables.</p>

<p><b>family</b> is R object to specify the details of the model. It's value is 'Poisson' for Logistic Regression.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We have the in-built data set "warpbreaks" which describes the effect of wool type (A or B) and tension (low, medium or high) on the number of warp breaks per loom. Let's consider "breaks" as the response variable which is a count of number of breaks. The wool "type" and "tension" are taken as predictor variables.</p>

<h3>Input Data</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Create Regression Model</h2>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the summary we look for the p-value in the last column to be less than 0.05 to consider an impact of the predictor variable on the response variable. As seen the wooltype B having tension type M and H have impact on the count of breaks.</p>

<h1>R - Analysis of Covariance</h1>

<p>We use Regression analysis to create models which describe the effect of variation in predictor variables on the response variable. Sometimes, if we have a categorical variable with values like Yes/No or Male/Female etc. The simple regression analysis gives multiple results for each value of the categorical variable. In such scenario, we can study the effect of the categorical variable by using it along with the predictor variable and comparing the regression lines for each level of the categorical variable. Such an analysis is termed as <b>Analysis of Covariance</b> also called as <b>ANCOVA</b>.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Consider the R built in data set mtcars. In it we observer that the field "am" represents the type of transmission (auto or manual). It is a categorical variable with values 0 and 1. The miles per gallon value(mpg) of a car can also depend on it besides the value of horse power("hp").</p>

<p>We study the effect of the value of "am" on the regression between "mpg" and "hp". It is done by using the <b>aov()</b> function followed by the <b>anova()</b> function to compare the multiple regressions.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>Create a data frame containing the fields "mpg", "hp" and "am" from the data set mtcars. Here we take "mpg" as the response variable, "hp" as the predictor variable and "am" as the categorical variable.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>ANCOVA Analysis</h2>

<p>We create a regression model taking "hp" as the predictor variable and "mpg" as the response variable taking into account the interaction between "am" and "hp".</p>

<h3>Model with interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result shows that both horse power and transmission type has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value in both cases is less than 0.05. But the interaction between these two variables is not significant as the p-value is more than 0.05.</p>

<h3>Model without interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable</h3>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>This result shows that both horse power and transmission type has significant effect on miles per gallon as the p value in both cases is less than 0.05.</p>

<h2>Comparing Two Models</h2>

<p>Now we can compare the two models to conclude if the interaction of the variables is truly in-significant. For this we use the <b>anova()</b> function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>As the p-value is greater than 0.05 we conclude that the interaction between horse power and transmission type is not significant. So the mileage per gallon will depend in a similar manner on the horse power of the car in both auto and manual transmission mode.</p>

<h1>R - Time Series Analysis</h1>

<p>Time series is a series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp. A simple example is the price of a stock in the stock market at different points of time on a given day. Another example is the amount of rainfall in a region at different months of the year. R language uses many functions to create, manipulate and plot the time series data. The data for the time series is stored in an R object called <b>time-series object</b>. It is also a R data object like a vector or data frame.</p>

<p>The time series object is created by using the <b>ts()</b> function.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for <b>ts()</b> function in time series analysis is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>data</b> is a vector or matrix containing the values used in the time series.</p>

<p><b>start</b> specifies the start time for the first observation in time series.</p>

<p><b>end</b> specifies the end time for the last observation in time series.</p>

<p><b>frequency</b> specifies the number of observations per unit time.</p>

<p>Except the parameter "data" all other parameters are optional.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Consider the annual rainfall details at a place starting from January 2012. We create an R time series object for a period of 12 months and plot it.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>The Time series chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Different Time Intervals</h2>

<p>The value of the <b>frequency</b> parameter in the ts() function decides the time intervals at which the data points are measured. A value of 12 indicates that the time series is for 12 months. Other values and its meaning is as below &minus;</p>

<p><b>frequency = 12</b> pegs the data points for every month of a year.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 4</b> pegs the data points for every quarter of a year.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 6</b> pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of an hour.</p>

<p><b>frequency = 24*6</b> pegs the data points for every 10 minutes of a day.</p>

<h2>Multiple Time Series</h2>

<p>We can plot multiple time series in one chart by combining both the series into a matrix.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>The Multiple Time series chart &minus;</p>

<h1>R - Nonlinear Least Square</h1>

<p>When modeling real world data for regression analysis, we observe that it is rarely the case that the equation of the model is a linear equation giving a linear graph. Most of the time, the equation of the model of real world data involves mathematical functions of higher degree like an exponent of 3 or a sin function. In such a scenario, the plot of the model gives a curve rather than a line. The goal of both linear and non-linear regression is to adjust the values of the model's parameters to find the line or curve that comes closest to your data. On finding these values we will be able to estimate the response variable with good accuracy.</p>

<p>In Least Square regression, we establish a regression model in which the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of different points from the regression curve is minimized. We generally start with a defined model and assume some values for the coefficients. We then apply the <b>nls()</b> function of R to get the more accurate values along with the confidence intervals.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a nonlinear least square test in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is a nonlinear model formula including variables and parameters.</p>

<p><b>data</b> is a data frame used to evaluate the variables in the formula.</p>

<p><b>start</b> is a named list or named numeric vector of starting estimates.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will consider a nonlinear model with assumption of initial values of its coefficients. Next we will see what is the confidence intervals of these assumed values so that we can judge how well these values fir into the model.</p>

<p>So let's consider the below equation for this purpose &minus;</p>

<p>Let's assume the initial coefficients to be 1 and 3 and fit these values into nls() function.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>We can conclude that the value of b1 is more close to 1 while the value of b2 is more close to 2 and not 3.</p>

<h1>R - Decision Tree</h1>

<p>Decision tree is a graph to represent choices and their results in form of a tree. The nodes in the graph represent an event or choice and the edges of the graph represent the decision rules or conditions. It is mostly used in Machine Learning and Data Mining applications using R.</p>

<p>Examples of use of decision tress is &minus; predicting an email as spam or not spam, predicting of a tumor is cancerous or predicting a loan as a good or bad credit risk based on the factors in each of these. Generally, a model is created with observed data also called training data. Then a set of validation data is used to verify and improve the model. R has packages which are used to create and visualize decision trees. For new set of predictor variable, we use this model to arrive at a decision on the category (yes/No, spam/not spam) of the data.</p>

<p>The R package <b>"party"</b> is used to create decision trees.</p>

<h2>Install R Package</h2>

<p>Use the below command in R console to install the package. You also have to install the dependent packages if any.</p>

<p>The package "party" has the function <b>ctree()</b> which is used to create and analyze decison tree.</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the name of the data set used.</p>

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<p>We will use the R in-built data set named <b>readingSkills</b> to create a decision tree. It describes the score of someone's readingSkills if we know the variables "age","shoesize","score" and whether the person is a native speaker or not.</p>

<p>Here is the sample data.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will use the <b>ctree()</b> function to create the decision tree and see its graph.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>From the decision tree shown above we can conclude that anyone whose readingSkills score is less than 38.3 and age is more than 6 is not a native Speaker.</p>

<h1>R - Random Forest</h1>

<p>In the random forest approach, a large number of decision trees are created. Every observation is fed into every decision tree. The most common outcome for each observation is used as the final output. A new observation is fed into all the trees and taking a majority vote for each classification model.</p>

<p>An error estimate is made for the cases which were not used while building the tree. That is called an <b>OOB (Out-of-bag)</b> error estimate which is mentioned as a percentage.</p>

<p>The R package <b>"randomForest"</b> is used to create random forests.</p>

<h2>Install R Package</h2>

<p>Use the below command in R console to install the package. You also have to install the dependent packages if any.</p>

<p>The package "randomForest" has the function <b>randomForest()</b> which is used to create and analyze random forests.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We will use the <b>randomForest()</b> function to create the decision tree and see it's graph.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>From the random forest shown above we can conclude that the shoesize and score are the important factors deciding if someone is a native speaker or not. Also the model has only 1% error which means we can predict with 99% accuracy.</p>

<h1>R - Survival Analysis</h1>

<p>Survival analysis deals with predicting the time when a specific event is going to occur. It is also known as failure time analysis or analysis of time to death. For example predicting the number of days a person with cancer will survive or predicting the time when a mechanical system is going to fail.</p>

<p>The R package named <b>survival</b> is used to carry out survival analysis. This package contains the function <b>Surv()</b> which takes the input data as a R formula and creates a survival object among the chosen variables for analysis. Then we use the function <b>survfit()</b> to create a plot for the analysis.</p>

<h2>Install Package</h2>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The basic syntax for creating survival analysis in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>time</b> is the follow up time until the event occurs.</p>

<p><b>event</b> indicates the status of occurrence of the expected event.</p>

<p><b>formula</b> is the relationship between the predictor variables.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>We will consider the data set named "pbc" present in the survival packages installed above. It describes the survival data points about people affected with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver. Among the many columns present in the data set we are primarily concerned with the fields "time" and "status". Time represents the number of days between registration of the patient and earlier of the event between the patient receiving a liver transplant or death of the patient.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>From the above data we are considering time and status for our analysis.</p>

<h3>Applying Surv() and survfit() Function</h3>

<p>Now we proceed to apply the <b>Surv()</b> function to the above data set and create a plot that will show the trend.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>

<p>The trend in the above graph helps us predicting the probability of survival at the end of a certain number of days.</p>

<h1>R - Chi Square Test</h1>

<p><b>Chi-Square test</b> is a statistical method to determine if two categorical variables have a significant correlation between them. Both those variables should be from same population and they should be categorical like &minus; Yes/No, Male/Female, Red/Green etc.</p>

<p>For example, we can build a data set with observations on people's ice-cream buying pattern and try to correlate the gender of a person with the flavor of the ice-cream they prefer. If a correlation is found we can plan for appropriate stock of flavors by knowing the number of gender of people visiting.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>The function used for performing chi-Square test is <b>chisq.test()</b>.</p>

<p>The basic syntax for creating a chi-square test in R is &minus;</p>

<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<p><b>data</b> is the data in form of a table containing the count value of the variables in the observation.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>We will take the Cars93 data in the "MASS" library which represents the sales of different models of car in the year 1993.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The above result shows the dataset has many Factor variables which can be considered as categorical variables. For our model we will consider the variables "AirBags" and "Type". Here we aim to find out any significant correlation between the types of car sold and the type of Air bags it has. If correlation is observed we can estimate which types of cars can sell better with what types of air bags.</p>

<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The result shows the p-value of less than 0.05 which indicates a string correlation.</p>

<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>
<p>If you are still willing to set up your environment for R, you can follow the steps given below.</p>
<h3>Windows Installation</h3>
<p>You can download the Windows installer version of R from <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R-3.2.2 for Windows (32/64 bit)</a> and save it in a local directory.</p>
<p>As it is a Windows installer (.exe) with a name "R-version-win.exe". You can just double click and run the installer accepting the default settings. If your Windows is 32-bit version, it installs the 32-bit version. But if your windows is 64-bit, then it installs both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions.</p>
<p>After installation you can locate the icon to run the Program in a directory structure "R\R3.2.2\bin\i386\Rgui.exe" under the Windows Program Files. Clicking this icon brings up the R-GUI which is the R console to do R Programming.</p>
<h3>Linux Installation</h3>
<p>R is available as a binary for many versions of Linux at the location <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Binaries</a>.</p>
<p>The instruction to install Linux varies from flavor to flavor. These steps are mentioned under each type of Linux version in the mentioned link. However, if you are in a hurry, then you can use <b>yum</b> command to install R as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ yum install R
</pre>
<p>Above command will install core functionality of R programming along with standard packages, still you need additional package, then you can launch R prompt as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ R

&gt;  
</pre>
<p>Now you can use install command at R prompt to install the required package. For example, the following command will install <b>plotrix</b> package which is required for 3D charts.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&gt; install("plotrix")
</pre>
<h1>R - Basic Syntax</h1>
<p>As a convention, we will start learning R programming by writing a "Hello, World!" program. Depending on the needs, you can program either at R command prompt or you can use an R script file to write your program. Let's check both one by one.</p>
<h2>R Command Prompt</h2>
<p>Once you have R environment setup, then it’s easy to start your R command prompt by just typing the following command at your command prompt &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ R
</pre>
<p>This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt &gt; where you can start typing your program as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&gt; myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"
&gt; print ( myString)
[1] "Hello, World!"
</pre>
<p>Here first statement defines a string variable myString, where we assign a string "Hello, World!" and then next statement print() is being used to print the value stored in variable myString.</p>
<h2>R Script File</h2>
<p>Usually, you will do your programming by writing your programs in script files and then you execute those scripts at your command prompt with the help of R interpreter called <b>Rscript</b>. So let's start with writing following code in a text file called test.R as under &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# My first program in R Programming
myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"

print ( myString)
</pre>
<p>Save the above code in a file test.R and execute it at Linux command prompt as given below. Even if you are using Windows or other system, syntax will remain same.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
$ Rscript test.R 
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "Hello, World!"
</pre>
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are like helping text in your R program and they are ignored by the interpreter while executing your actual program. Single comment is written using # in the beginning of the statement as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
# My first program in R Programming
</pre>
<p>R does not support multi-line comments but you can perform a trick which is something as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
if(FALSE) {
   "This is a demo for multi-line comments and it should be put inside either a single
      OR double quote"
}

myString &lt;- "Hello, World!"
print ( myString)
</pre>
<p>Though above comments will be executed by R interpreter, they will not interfere with your actual program. You should put such comments inside, either single or double quote.</p>
<h1>R - Data Types</h1>
<p>Generally, while doing programming in any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that, when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
<p>You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, Boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>
<p>In contrast to other programming languages like C and java in R, the variables are not declared as some data type. The variables are assigned with R-Objects and the data type of the R-object becomes the data type of the variable. There are many types of R-objects. The frequently used ones are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Vectors</li>
<li>Lists</li>    
<li>Matrices</li>   
<li>Arrays</li>
<li>Factors</li>
<li>Data Frames</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest of these objects is the <b>vector object</b> and there are six data types of these atomic vectors, also termed as six classes of vectors. The other R-Objects are built upon the atomic vectors.</p>

<p>In R programming, the very basic data types are the R-objects called <b>vectors</b> which hold elements of different classes as shown above. Please note in R the number of classes is not confined to only the above six types. For example, we can use many atomic vectors and create an array whose class will become array.</p>   
<h2>Vectors</h2>
<p>When you want to create vector with more than one element, you should use <b>c()</b> function which means to combine the elements into a vector.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector.
apple &lt;- c('red','green',"yellow")
print(apple)

# Get the class of the vector.
print(class(apple))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "red"    "green"  "yellow"
[1] "character"
</pre>
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>A list is an R-object which can contain many different types of elements inside it like vectors, functions and even another list inside it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a list.
list1 &lt;- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)

# Print the list.
print(list1)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[[1]]
[1] 2 5 3

[[2]]
[1] 21.3

[[3]]
function (x)  .Primitive("sin")
</pre>
<h2>Matrices</h2>
<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. It can be created using a vector input to the matrix function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a matrix.
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] "a"  "a"  "b" 
[2,] "c"  "b"  "a"
</pre>
<h2>Arrays</h2>
<p>While matrices are confined to two dimensions, arrays can be of any number of dimensions. The array function takes a dim attribute which creates the required number of dimension. In the below example we create an array with two elements which are 3x3 matrices each.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create an array.
a &lt;- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(a)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
, , 1

     [,1]     [,2]     [,3]    
[1,] "green"  "yellow" "green" 
[2,] "yellow" "green"  "yellow"
[3,] "green"  "yellow" "green" 

, , 2

     [,1]     [,2]     [,3]    
[1,] "yellow" "green"  "yellow"
[2,] "green"  "yellow" "green" 
[3,] "yellow" "green"  "yellow"  
</pre>
<h2>Factors</h2>
<p>Factors are the r-objects which are created using a vector. It stores the vector along with the distinct values of the elements in the vector as labels. The labels are always character irrespective of whether it is numeric or character or Boolean etc. in the input vector. They are useful in statistical modeling.</p>
<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor()</b> function.The <b>nlevels</b> functions gives the count of levels.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector.
apple_colors &lt;- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')

# Create a factor object.
factor_apple &lt;- factor(apple_colors)

# Print the factor.
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] green  green  yellow red    red    red   green 
Levels: green red yellow
# applying the nlevels function we can know the number of distinct values
[1] 3
</pre> 
<h2>Data Frames</h2>
<p>Data frames are tabular data objects. Unlike a matrix in data frame each column can contain different modes of data. The first column can be numeric while the second column can be character and third column can be logical. It is a list of vectors of equal length.</p>
<p>Data Frames are created using the <b>data.frame()</b> function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the data frame.
BMI &lt;- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
)
print(BMI)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
  gender height weight Age
1   Male  152.0     81  42
2   Male  171.5     93  38
3 Female  165.0     78  26  
</pre>
<h1>R - Variables</h1>
<p>A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. A variable in R can store an atomic vector, group of atomic vectors or a combination of many Robjects. A valid variable name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters. The variable name starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:22%;">Variable Name</th>
<th>Validity</th>
<th>Reason</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>var_name2.</td>
<td>valid</td>
<td>Has letters, numbers, dot and underscore</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>var_name%</td>
<td>Invalid</td>
<td>Has the character '%'. Only dot(.) and underscore allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2var_name</td>
<td>invalid</td>
<td>Starts with a number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.var_name ,<br> var.name</td>
<td>valid</td>
<td>Can start with a dot(.) but the dot(.)should not be followed by a number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>.2var_name</td>
<td>invalid</td>
<td>The starting dot is followed by a number making it invalid.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>_var_name</td>
<td>invalid</td>
<td>Starts with _ which is not valid</td>
</tr>     
</table>
<h2>Variable Assignment</h2>
<p>The variables can be assigned values using leftward, rightward and equal to operator. The values of the variables can be printed using <b>print()</b> or <b>cat()</b>function. The <b>cat()</b> function combines multiple items into a continuous print output.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Assignment using equal operator.
var.1 = c(0,1,2,3)           

# Assignment using leftward operator.
var.2 &lt;- c("learn","R")   

# Assignment using rightward operator.   
c(TRUE,1) -&gt; var.3           

print(var.1)
cat ("var.1 is ", var.1 ,"\n")
cat ("var.2 is ", var.2 ,"\n")
cat ("var.3 is ", var.3 ,"\n")
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 0 1 2 3
var.1 is  0 1 2 3 
var.2 is  learn R 
var.3 is  1 1 
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The vector c(TRUE,1) has a mix of logical and numeric class. So logical class is coerced to numeric class making TRUE as 1.</p>
<h2>Data Type of a Variable</h2>
<p>In R, a variable itself is not declared of any data type, rather it gets the data type of the R - object assigned to it. So R is called a dynamically typed language, which means that we can change a variable’s data type of the same variable again and again when using it in a program.</p> 
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
var_x &lt;- "Hello"
cat("The class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")

var_x &lt;- 34.5
cat("  Now the class of var_x is ",class(var_x),"\n")

var_x &lt;- 27L
cat("   Next the class of var_x becomes ",class(var_x),"\n")
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The class of var_x is  character 
   Now the class of var_x is  numeric 
      Next the class of var_x becomes  integer
</pre>
<h2>Finding Variables</h2>
<p>To know all the variables currently available in the workspace we use the <b>ls()</b> function. Also the ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p> 
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
print(ls())
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "my var"     "my_new_var" "my_var"     "var.1"      
[5] "var.2"      "var.3"      "var.name"   "var_name2."
[9] "var_x"      "varname" 
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; It is a sample output depending on what variables are declared in your environment.</p>
<p>The ls() function can use patterns to match the variable names.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# List the variables starting with the pattern "var".
print(ls(pattern = "var"))   
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "my var"     "my_new_var" "my_var"     "var.1"      
[5] "var.2"      "var.3"      "var.name"   "var_name2."
[9] "var_x"      "varname"    
</pre>
<p>The variables starting with <b>dot(.)</b> are hidden, they can be listed using "all.names = TRUE" argument to ls() function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
print(ls(all.name = TRUE))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] ".cars"        ".Random.seed" ".var_name"    ".varname"     ".varname2"   
[6] "my var"       "my_new_var"   "my_var"       "var.1"        "var.2"        
[11]"var.3"        "var.name"     "var_name2."   "var_x"  
</pre>
<h2>Deleting Variables</h2>
<p>Variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> function. Below we delete the variable var.3. On printing the value of the variable error is thrown.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
rm(var.3)
print(var.3)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] "var.3"
Error in print(var.3) : object 'var.3' not found
</pre>    
<p>All the variables can be deleted by using the <b>rm()</b> and <b>ls()</b> function together.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
rm(list = ls())
print(ls())
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>R - Functions</h1>
<p>A function is a set of statements organized together to perform a specific task. R has a large number of in-built functions and the user can create their own functions.</p>
<p>In R, a function is an object so the R interpreter is able to pass control to the function, along with arguments that may be necessary for the function to accomplish the actions.</p>
<p>The function in turn performs its task and returns control to the interpreter as well as any result which may be stored in other objects.</p>
<h2>Function Definition</h2>
<p>An R function is created by using the keyword <b>function</b>. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
function_name &lt;- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...) {
   Function body 
}
</pre>
<h2>Function Components </h2>
<p>The different parts of a function are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Function Name</b> &minus; This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in R environment as an object with this name.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Arguments</b> &minus; An argument is a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the argument. Arguments are optional; that is, a function may contain no arguments. Also arguments can have default values.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Function Body</b> &minus; The function body contains a collection of statements that defines what the function does.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; The return value of a function is the last expression in the function body to be evaluated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>R has many <b>in-built</b> functions which can be directly called in the program without defining them first. We can also create and use our own functions referred as <b>user defined</b> functions.</p>
<h2>Built-in Function</h2>
<p>Simple examples of in-built functions are <b>seq()</b>, <b>mean()</b>, <b>max()</b>, <b>sum(x)</b> and <b>paste(...)</b> etc. They are directly called by user written programs. You can refer <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">most widely used R functions.</a></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a sequence of numbers from 32 to 44.

<h1>R - Strings</h1>
<p>Any value written within a pair of single quote or double quotes in R is treated as a string. Internally R stores every string within double quotes, even when you create them with single quote.</p>
<h2>Rules Applied in String Construction</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The quotes at the beginning and end of a string should be both double quotes or both single quote. They can not be mixed.</p></li>
<li><p>Double quotes can be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p></li>
<li><p>Single quote can be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Double quotes can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with double quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Single quote can not be inserted into a string starting and ending with single quote.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples of Valid Strings</h3>
<p>Following examples clarify the rules about creating a string in R.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a &lt;- 'Start and end with single quote'
print(a)

b &lt;- "Start and end with double quotes"
print(b)

c &lt;- "single quote ' in between double quotes"
print(c)

d &lt;- 'Double quotes " in between single quote'
print(d)

<h2>String Manipulation</h2>
<h3>Concatenating Strings - paste() function</h3>
<p>Many strings in R are combined using the <b>paste()</b> function. It can take any number of arguments to be combined together.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The basic syntax for paste function is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
paste(..., sep = " ", collapse = NULL)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>...</b> represents any number of arguments to be combined.</p></li>
<li><p><b>sep</b> represents any separator between the arguments. It is optional.</p></li>
<li><p><b>collapse</b> is used to eliminate the space in between two strings. But not the space within two words of one string.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
a &lt;- "Hello"
b &lt;- 'How'
c &lt;- "are you? "

<h1>R - Arrays</h1>
<p>Arrays are the R data objects which can store data in more than two dimensions. For example &minus; If we create an array of dimension (2, 3, 4) then it creates 4 rectangular matrices each with 2 rows and 3 columns. Arrays can store only data type.</p>
<p>An array is created using the <b>array()</b> function. It takes vectors as input and uses the values in the <b>dim</b> parameter to create an array.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example creates an array of two 3x3 matrices each with 3 rows and 3 columns.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 &lt;- c(5,9,3)
vector2 &lt;- c(10,11,12,13,14,15)

# Take these vectors as input to the array.
result &lt;- array(c(vector1,vector2),dim = c(3,3,2))
print(result)

<h2>Calculations Across Array Elements</h2>
<p>We can do calculations across the elements in an array using the <b>apply()</b> function.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
apply(x, margin, fun)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>

<li><p><b>fun</b> is the function to be applied across the elements of the array.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>We use the apply() function below to calculate the sum of the elements in the rows of an array across all the matrices.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create two vectors of different lengths.
vector1 &lt;- c(5,9,3)

<h1>R - Factors</h1>
<p>Factors are the data objects which are used to categorize the data and store it as levels. They can store both strings and integers. They are useful in the columns which have a limited number of unique values. Like "Male, "Female" and True, False etc. They are useful in data analysis for statistical modeling.</p>
<p>Factors are created using the <b>factor ()</b> function by taking a vector as input.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector as input.
data &lt;- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West","West","West","East","North")

print(data)
print(is.factor(data))

# Apply the factor function.
factor_data &lt;- factor(data)

print(factor_data)
print(is.factor(factor_data))
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
 [1] "East"  "West"  "East"  "North" "North" "East"  "West"  "West"  "West"  "East" "North"
[1] FALSE
 [1] East  West  East  North North East  West  West  West  East  North
Levels: East North West
[1] TRUE
</pre>
<h2>Factors in Data Frame</h2>
<p>On creating any data frame with a column of text data, R treats the text column as categorical data and creates factors on it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the vectors for data frame.
height &lt;- c(132,151,162,139,166,147,122)
weight &lt;- c(48,49,66,53,67,52,40)
gender &lt;- c("male","male","female","female","male","female","male")

# Create the data frame.
input_data &lt;- data.frame(height,weight,gender)
print(input_data)

# Test if the gender column is a factor.
print(is.factor(input_data$gender))

# Print the gender column so see the levels.
print(input_data$gender)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
  height weight gender
1    132     48   male
2    151     49   male
3    162     66 female
4    139     53 female
5    166     67   male
6    147     52 female
7    122     40   male
[1] TRUE
[1] male   male   female female male   female male  
Levels: female male
</pre>
<h2>Changing the Order of Levels</h2>
<p>The order of the levels in a factor can be changed by applying the factor function again with new order of the levels.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
data &lt;- c("East","West","East","North","North","East","West","West","West","East","North")
# Create the factors
factor_data &lt;- factor(data)
print(factor_data)

# Apply the factor function with required order of the level.
new_order_data &lt;- factor(factor_data,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_order_data)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
 [1] East  West  East  North North East  West  West  West  East  North
Levels: East North West
 [1] East  West  East  North North East  West  West  West  East  North
Levels: East West North
</pre>
<h2>Generating Factor Levels</h2>
<p>We can generate factor levels by using the <b>gl()</b> function. It takes two integers as input which indicates how many levels and how many times each level.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
gl(n, k, labels)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>n</b> is a integer giving the number of levels.</p></li>
<li><p><b>k</b> is a integer giving the number of replications.</p></li>
<li><p><b>labels</b> is a vector of labels for the resulting factor levels.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
v &lt;- gl(3, 4, labels = c("Tampa", "Seattle","Boston"))
print(v)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Following are the characteristics of a data frame.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The column names should be non-empty.</li>

<h1>R - Packages</h1>
<p>R packages are a collection of R functions, complied code and sample data. They are stored under a directory called <b>"library"</b> in the R environment. By default, R installs a set of packages during installation. More packages are added later, when they are needed for some specific purpose. When we start the R console, only the default packages are available by default. Other packages which are already installed have to be loaded explicitly to be used by the R program that is going to use them.</p>
<p>All the packages available in R language are listed at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">R Packages.</a></p>
<p>Below is a list of commands to be used to check, verify and use the R packages.</p>
<h2>Check Available R Packages</h2>
<p>Get library locations containing R packages</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
.libPaths()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[2] "C:/Program Files/R/R-3.2.2/library"
</pre>
<h2>Get the list of all the packages installed</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
library()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Packages in library ‘C:/Program Files/R/R-3.2.2/library’:

base                    The R Base Package
boot                    Bootstrap Functions (Originally by Angelo Canty

</pre>
<p>Get all packages currently loaded in the R environment</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
search()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result. It may vary depending on the local settings of your pc.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] ".GlobalEnv"        "package:stats"     "package:graphics" 
[4] "package:grDevices" "package:utils"     "package:datasets" 
[7] "package:methods"   "Autoloads"         "package:base" 
</pre>
<h2>Install a New Package</h2>
<p>There are two ways to add new R packages. One is installing directly from the CRAN directory and another is downloading the package to your local system and installing it manually.</p>
<h3>Install directly from CRAN</h3>
<p>The following command gets the packages directly from CRAN webpage and installs the package in the R environment. You may be prompted to choose a nearest mirror. Choose the one appropriate to your location.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
 install.packages("Package Name")
 
# Install the package named "XML".
 install.packages("XML")
</pre>
<h3>Install package manually</h3>
<p>Go to the link <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html">R Packages</a> to download the package needed. Save the package as a <b>.zip</b> file in a suitable location in the local system.</p>
<p>Now you can run the following command to install this package in the R environment.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
install.packages(file_name_with_path, repos = NULL, type = "source")

# Install the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
</pre>
<h2>Load Package to Library</h2>
<p>Before a package can be used in the code, it must be loaded to the current R environment. You also need to load a package that is already installed previously but not available in the current environment.</p>
<p>A package is loaded using the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
library("package Name", lib.loc = "path to library")

# Load the package named "XML"
install.packages("E:/XML_3.98-1.3.zip", repos = NULL, type = "source")
</pre>
<h1>R - Data Reshaping</h1>
<p>Data Reshaping in R is about changing the way data is organized into rows and columns. Most of the time data processing in R is done by taking the input data as a data frame. It is easy to extract data from the rows and columns of a data frame but there are situations when we need the data frame in a format that is different from format in which we received it. R has many functions to split, merge and change the rows to columns and vice-versa in a data frame.</p>
<h2>Joining Columns and Rows in a Data Frame</h2>
<p>We can join multiple vectors to create a data frame using the <b>cbind()</b>function. Also we can merge two data frames using <b>rbind()</b> function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create vector objects.
city &lt;- c("Tampa","Seattle","Hartford","Denver")
state &lt;- c("FL","WA","CT","CO")
zipcode &lt;- c(33602,98104,06161,80294)

# Combine above three vectors into one data frame.
addresses &lt;- cbind(city,state,zipcode)

# Print a header.
cat("# # # # The First data frame\n") 

# Print the data frame.
print(addresses)

# Create another data frame with similar columns
new.address &lt;- data.frame(
   city = c("Lowry","Charlotte"),
   state = c("CO","FL"),
   zipcode = c("80230","33949"),
   stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Print a header.
cat("# # # The Second data frame\n") 

# Print the data frame.
print(new.address)

# Combine rows form both the data frames.
all.addresses &lt;- rbind(addresses,new.address)

# Print a header.
cat("# # # The combined data frame\n") 

# Print the result.
print(all.addresses)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
# # # # The First data frame
     city       state zipcode
[1,] "Tampa"    "FL"  "33602"
[2,] "Seattle"  "WA"  "98104"
[3,] "Hartford" "CT"   "6161" 
[4,] "Denver"   "CO"  "80294"

# # # The Second data frame
       city       state   zipcode
1      Lowry      CO      80230
2      Charlotte  FL      33949

# # # The combined data frame
       city      state zipcode
1      Tampa     FL    33602
2      Seattle   WA    98104
3      Hartford  CT     6161
4      Denver    CO    80294
5      Lowry     CO    80230
6     Charlotte  FL    33949
</pre>
<h2>Merging Data Frames</h2>
<p>We can merge two data frames by using the <b>merge()</b> function. The data frames must have same column names on which the merging happens.</p>
<p>In the example below, we consider the data sets about Diabetes in Pima Indian Women available in the library names "MASS". we merge the two data sets based on the values of blood pressure("bp") and body mass index("bmi"). On choosing these two columns for merging, the records where values of these two variables match in both data sets are combined together to form a single data frame.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
library(MASS)
merged.Pima &lt;- merge(x = Pima.te, y = Pima.tr,
   by.x = c("bp", "bmi"),
   by.y = c("bp", "bmi")
)
print(merged.Pima)
nrow(merged.Pima)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>R - CSV Files</h1>
<p>In R, we can read data from files stored outside the R environment. We can also write data into files which will be stored and accessed by the operating system. R can read and write into various file formats like csv, excel, xml etc.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will learn to read data from a csv file and then write data into a csv file. The file should be present in current working directory so that R can read it. Of course we can also set our own directory and read files from there.</p>
<h2>Getting and Setting the Working Directory</h2>
<p>You can check which directory the R workspace is pointing to using the <b>getwd()</b> function. You can also set a new working directory using <b>setwd()</b>function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Get and print current working directory.
print(getwd())

# Set current working directory.
setwd("/web/com")

# Get and print current working directory.
print(getwd())

</pre>
<p>This result depends on your OS and your current directory where you are working.</p>
<h2>Input as CSV File</h2>
<p>The csv file is a text file in which the values in the columns are separated by a comma. Let's consider the following data present in the file named <b>input.csv</b>.</p>
<p>You can create this file using windows notepad by copying and pasting this data. Save the file as <b>input.csv</b> using the save As All files(*.*) option in notepad.</p>

<h1>R - Excel File</h1>
<p>Microsoft Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program which stores data in the .xls or .xlsx format. R can read directly from these files using some excel specific packages. Few such packages are - XLConnect, xlsx, gdata etc. We will be using xlsx package. R can also write into excel file using this package.</p>
<h2>Install xlsx Package</h2>
<p>You can use the following command in the R console to install the "xlsx" package. It may ask to install some additional packages on which this package is dependent. Follow the same command with required package name to install the additional packages.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
install.packages("xlsx")
</pre>
<h2>Verify and Load the "xlsx" Package</h2>
<p>Use the following command to verify and load the "xlsx" package.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Verify the package is installed.
any(grepl("xlsx",installed.packages()))

# Load the library into R workspace.
library("xlsx")
</pre>
<p>When the script is run we get the following output.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] TRUE

<h1>R - Binary Files</h1>
<p>A binary file is a file that contains information stored only in form of bits and bytes.(0’s and 1’s). They are not human readable as the bytes in it translate to characters and symbols which contain many other non-printable characters. Attempting to read a binary file using any text editor will show characters like &Oslash; and &eth;.</p>
<p>The binary file has to be read by specific programs to be useable. For example, the binary file of a Microsoft Word program can be read to a human readable form only by the Word program. Which indicates that, besides the human readable text, there is a lot more information like formatting of characters and page numbers etc., which are also stored along with alphanumeric characters. And finally a binary file is a continuous sequence of bytes. The line break we see in a text file is a character joining first line to the next.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the data generated by other programs are required to be processed by R as a binary file. Also R is required to create binary files which can be shared with other programs.</p>
<p>R has two functions <b>WriteBin()</b> and <b>readBin()</b> to create and read binary files.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre class="result notranslate">
writeBin(object, con)
readBin(con, what, n )
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>con</b> is the connection object to read or write the binary file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>object</b> is the binary file which to be written.</p></li>
<li><p><b>what</b> is the mode like character, integer etc. representing the bytes to be read.</p></li>
<li><p><b>n</b> is the number of bytes to read from the binary file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We consider the R inbuilt data "mtcars". First we create a csv file from it and convert it to a binary file and store it as a OS file. Next we read this binary file created into R.</p>
<h2>Writing the Binary File</h2>
<p>We read the data frame "mtcars" as a csv file and then write it as a binary file to the OS.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Read the "mtcars" data frame as a csv file and store only the columns 
   "cyl", "am" and "gear".
write.table(mtcars, file = "mtcars.csv",row.names = FALSE, na = "", 
   col.names = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Store 5 records from the csv file as a new data frame.
new.mtcars &lt;- read.table("mtcars.csv",sep = ",",header = TRUE,nrows = 5)

# Create a connection object to write the binary file using mode "wb".
write.filename = file("/web/com/binmtcars.dat", "wb")

# Write the column names of the data frame to the connection object.
writeBin(colnames(new.mtcars), write.filename)

# Write the records in each of the column to the file.
writeBin(c(new.mtcars$cyl,new.mtcars$am,new.mtcars$gear), write.filename)

# Close the file for writing so that it can be read by other program.
close(write.filename)
</pre>
<h2>Reading the Binary File</h2>
<p>The binary file created above stores all the data as continuous bytes. So we will read it by choosing appropriate values of column names as well as the column values.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Create a connection object to read the file in binary mode using "rb".
read.filename &lt;- file("/web/com/binmtcars.dat", "rb")

# First read the column names. n = 3 as we have 3 columns.
column.names &lt;- readBin(read.filename, character(),  n = 3)

# Next read the column values. n = 18 as we have 3 column names and 15 values.
read.filename &lt;- file("/web/com/binmtcars.dat", "rb")
bindata &lt;- readBin(read.filename, integer(),  n = 18)

# Print the data.
print(bindata)

# Read the values from 4th byte to 8th byte which represents "cyl".
cyldata = bindata[4:8]
print(cyldata)

# Read the values form 9th byte to 13th byte which represents "am".
amdata = bindata[9:13]
print(amdata)

# Read the values form 9th byte to 13th byte which represents "gear".
geardata = bindata[14:18]
print(geardata)

# Combine all the read values to a dat frame.
finaldata = cbind(cyldata, amdata, geardata)
colnames(finaldata) = column.names
print(finaldata)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
 [1]    7108963 1728081249    7496037          6          6          4

<p>As we can see, we got the original data back by reading the binary file in R.</p>
<h1>R - XML Files</h1>
<p>XML is a file format which shares both the file format and the data on the World Wide Web, intranets, and elsewhere using standard ASCII text. It stands for Extensible Markup Language (XML). Similar to HTML it contains markup tags. But unlike HTML where the markup tag describes structure of the page, in xml the markup tags describe the meaning of the data contained into he file.</p>
<p>You can read a xml file in R using the "XML" package. This package can be installed using following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
install.packages("XML")

<h2>Input Data</h2>

<h1>R - Web Data</h1>
<p>Many websites provide data for consumption by its users. For example the World Health Organization(WHO) provides reports on health and medical information in the form of CSV, txt and XML files. Using R programs, we can programmatically extract specific data from such websites. Some packages in R which are used to scrap data form the web are &minus; "RCurl",XML", and "stringr". They are used to connect to the URL’s, identify required links for the files and download them to the local environment.</p>
<h2>Install R Packages</h2>
<p>The following packages are required for processing the URL’s and links to the files. If they are not available in your R Environment, you can install them using following commands.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
install.packages("RCurl")
install.packages("XML")
install.packages("stringr")
install.packages("pylr")
</pre>
<h2>Input Data</h2>
<p>We will visit the URL <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">weather data</a> and download the CSV files using R for the year 2015.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We will use the function <b>getHTMLLinks()</b> to gather the URLs of the files. Then we will use the function <b>downlaod.file()</b> to save the files to the local system. As we will be applying the same code again and again for multiple files, we will create a function to be called multiple times. The filenames are passed as parameters in form of a R list object to this function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Read the URL.
url &lt;- "http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/"

# Gather the html links present in the webpage.
links &lt;- getHTMLLinks(url)

# Identify only the links which point to the JCMB 2015 files. 
filenames &lt;- links[str_detect(links, "JCMB_2015")]

# Store the file names as a list.
filenames_list &lt;- as.list(filenames)

# Create a function to download the files by passing the URL and filename list.
downloadcsv &lt;- function (mainurl,filename) {
   filedetails &lt;- str_c(mainurl,filename)
   download.file(filedetails,filename)
}

# Now apply the l_ply function and save the files into the current R working directory.
l_ply(filenames,downloadcsv,mainurl = "http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~weather/jcmb_ws/")
</pre>
<h2>Verify the File Download</h2>
<p>After running the above code, you can locate the following files in the current R working directory.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
"JCMB_2015.csv" "JCMB_2015_Apr.csv" "JCMB_2015_Feb.csv" "JCMB_2015_Jan.csv"
   "JCMB_2015_Mar.csv"

<h1>R - Databases</h1>
<p>The data is Relational database systems are stored in a normalized format. So, to carry out statistical computing we will need very advanced and complex Sql queries. But R can connect easily to many relational databases like MySql, Oracle, Sql server etc. and fetch records from them as a data frame. Once the data is available in the R environment, it becomes a normal R data set and can be manipulated or analyzed using all the powerful packages and functions.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will be using MySql as our reference database for connecting to R.</p>
<h2>RMySQL Package</h2>
<p>R has a built-in package named "RMySQL" which provides native connectivity between with MySql database. You can install this package in the R environment using the following command.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
install.packages("RMySQL")
</pre>
<h2>Connecting R to MySql</h2>
<p>Once the package is installed we create a connection object in R to connect to the database. It takes the username, password, database name and host name as input.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Create a connection Object to MySQL database.
# We will connect to the sampel database named "sakila" that comes with MySql installation.
mysqlconnection = dbConnect(MySQL(), user = 'root', password = '', dbname = 'sakila',
   host = 'localhost')

# List the tables available in this database.
 dbListTables(mysqlconnection)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h2>Querying the Tables</h2>
<p>We can query the database tables in MySql using the function <b>dbSendQuery()</b>. The query gets executed in MySql and the result set is returned using the R <b>fetch()</b> function. Finally it is stored as a data frame in R.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Query the "actor" tables to get all the rows.
result = dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection, "select * from actor")

# Store the result in a R data frame object. n = 5 is used to fetch first 5 rows.
data.frame = fetch(result, n = 5)
print(data.fame)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h2>Query with Filter Clause</h2>
<p>We can pass any valid select query to get the result.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
result = dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection, "select * from actor where last_name = 'TORN'")

# Fetch all the records(with n = -1) and store it as a data frame.
data.frame = fetch(result, n = -1)
print(data)

<h2>Updating Rows in the Tables</h2>
<p>We can update the rows in a Mysql table by passing the update query to the dbSendQuery() function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection, "update mtcars set disp = 168.5 where hp = 110")
</pre>
<p>After executing the above code we can see the table updated in the MySql Environment.</p>
<h2>Inserting Data into the Tables</h2>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection,
   "insert into mtcars(row_names, mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt, qsec, vs, am, gear, carb)
   values('New Mazda RX4 Wag', 21, 6, 168.5, 110, 3.9, 2.875, 17.02, 0, 1, 4, 4)"
)
</pre>
<p>After executing the above code we can see the row inserted into the table in the MySql Environment.</p>
<h2>Creating Tables in MySql</h2>
<p>We can create tables in the MySql using the function <b>dbWriteTable()</b>. It overwrites the table if it already exists and takes a data frame as input.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Create the connection object to the database where we want to create the table.
mysqlconnection = dbConnect(MySQL(), user = 'root', password = '', dbname = 'sakila', 
   host = 'localhost')

# Use the R data frame "mtcars" to create the table in MySql.
# All the rows of mtcars are taken inot MySql.
dbWriteTable(mysqlconnection, "mtcars", mtcars[, ], overwrite = TRUE)
</pre>
<p>After executing the above code we can see the table created in the MySql Environment.</p>
<h2>Dropping Tables in MySql</h2>
<p>We can drop the tables in MySql database passing the drop table statement into the dbSendQuery() in the same way we used it for querying data from tables.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
dbSendQuery(mysqlconnection, 'drop table if exists mtcars')
</pre>
<p>After executing the above code we can see the table is dropped in the MySql Environment.</p>
<h1>R - Pie Charts</h1>
<p>R Programming language has numerous libraries to create charts and graphs. A pie-chart is a representation of values as slices of a circle with different colors. The slices are labeled and the numbers corresponding to each slice is also represented in the chart.</p>
<p>In R the pie chart is created using the <b>pie()</b> function which takes positive numbers as a vector input. The additional parameters are used to control labels, color, title etc.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The basic syntax for creating a pie-chart using the R is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
pie(x, labels, radius, main, col, clockwise)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>x</b> is a vector containing the numeric values used in the pie chart.</p></li>
<li><p><b>labels</b> is used to give description to the slices.</p></li>
<li><p><b>radius</b> indicates the radius of the circle of the pie chart.(value between &minus;1 and &plus;1).</p></li>
<li><p><b>main</b> indicates the title of the chart.</p></li>
<li><p><b>col</b> indicates the color palette.</p></li>
<li><p><b>clockwise</b> is a logical value indicating if the slices are drawn clockwise or anti clockwise.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A very simple pie-chart is created using just the input vector and labels. The below script will create and save the pie chart in the current R working directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create data for the graph.
x &lt;- c(21, 62, 10, 53)
labels &lt;- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x,labels)

# Save the file.
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<img src="/r/images/city.jpg" alt="Pie Chatr using R" />
<h2>Pie Chart Title and Colors</h2>
<p>We can expand the features of the chart by adding more parameters to the function. We will use parameter <b>main</b> to add a title to the chart and another parameter is <b>col</b> which will make use of rainbow colour pallet while drawing the chart. The length of the pallet should be same as the number of values we have for the chart. Hence we use length(x).</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The below script will create and save the pie chart in the current R working directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create data for the graph.
x &lt;- c(21, 62, 10, 53)
labels &lt;- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city_title_colours.jpg")

# Plot the chart with title and rainbow color pallet.
pie(x, labels, main = "City pie chart", col = rainbow(length(x)))

# Save the file.
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<img src="/r/images/city_title_colours.jpg" alt="Pie-chart with title and colours" />
<h2>Slice Percentages and Chart Legend</h2>
<p>We can add slice percentage and a chart legend by creating additional chart variables.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create data for the graph.
x &lt;-  c(21, 62, 10,53)
labels &lt;-  c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai")

piepercent&lt;- round(100*x/sum(x), 1)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city_percentage_legends.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x, labels = piepercent, main = "City pie chart",col = rainbow(length(x)))
legend("topright", c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai"), cex = 0.8,
   fill = rainbow(length(x)))

# Save the file.
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<img src="/r/images/city_percentage_legends.jpg" alt="pie-chart with percentage and labels" />
<h2>3D Pie Chart</h2>
<p>A pie chart with 3 dimensions can be drawn using additional packages. The package <b>plotrix</b> has a function called <b>pie3D()</b> that is used for this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Get the library.
library(plotrix)

# Create data for the graph.
x &lt;-  c(21, 62, 10,53)
lbl &lt;-  c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "3d_pie_chart.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie3D(x,labels = lbl,explode = 0.1, main = "Pie Chart of Countries ")

# Save the file.
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<img src="/r/images/3d_pie_chart.jpg" alt="3D pie-chart" />
<h1>R - Bar Charts</h1>
<p>A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of the variable.</p>
<p> R uses the function <b>barplot()</b> to create bar charts.
 R can draw both vertical and Horizontal bars in the bar chart.
In bar chart each of the bars can be given different colors.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The basic syntax to create a bar-chart in R is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
barplot(H,xlab,ylab,main, names.arg,col)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used :</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><b>H</b> is a vector or matrix containing numeric values used in bar chart.</li>
<li><b>xlab</b> is the label for x axis.</li>
<li><b>ylab</b> is the label for y axis.</li>
<li><b>main</b> is the title of the bar chart.</li>
<li><b>names.arg</b> is a vector of names appearing under each bar.</li>
<li><b>col</b> is used to give colors to the bars in the graph.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>A simple bar chart is created using just the input vector and the name of each bar.</p>
<p> The below script will create and save the bar chart in the current R working directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the data for the chart
H &lt;- c(7,12,28,3,41)

# Give the chart file a name
png(file = "barchart.png")

# Plot the bar chart 
barplot(H)

# Save the file
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute above code, it produces following result &minus;</p>
<img src="/r/images/barchart.png" alt="Bar Chart using R" />
<h2>Bar Chart Labels, Title and Colors</h2>
<p>The features of the bar chart can be expanded by adding more parameters. The <b>main</b> parameter is used to add  <b>title</b>.
The <b>col</b> parameter is used to add colors to the bars.
The <b>args.name</b> is a vector having same number of values as the input vector to describe the meaning of each bar.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
</p>The below script will create and save the bar chart in the current R working directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the data for the chart
H &lt;- c(7,12,28,3,41)
M &lt;- c("Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul")

# Give the chart file a name

<h1>R - Boxplots</h1>
<p>Boxplots are a measure of how well distributed is the data in a data set. It divides the data set into three quartiles. This graph represents the minimum, maximum, median, first quartile and third quartile in the data set. It is also useful in comparing the distribution of data across data sets by drawing boxplots for each of them.</p>
<p>Boxplots are created in R by using the <b>boxplot()</b> function.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The basic syntax to create a boxplot in R is  &minus;</p>

<li><p><b>data</b> is the data frame.</p></li>
<li><p><b>notch</b> is a logical value. Set as TRUE to draw a notch.</p></li>
<li><p><b>varwidth</b> is a logical value. Set as true to draw width of the box proportionate to the sample size.</p></li>
<li><p><b>names</b> are the group labels which will be printed under each boxplot.</p></li>
<li><p><b>main</b> is used to give a title to the graph.</p></li>

<h1>R - Mean, Median &amp; Mode</h1>
<p>Statistical analysis in R is performed by using many in-built functions. Most of these functions are part of the R base package. These functions take R vector as an input along with the arguments and give the result.</p>
<p>The functions we are discussing in this chapter are mean, median and mode.</p>
<h2>Mean</h2>
<p>It is calculated by taking the sum of the values and dividing with the number of values in a data series.</p>
<p>The function <b>mean()</b> is used to calculate this in R.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The basic syntax for calculating mean in R is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
mean(x, trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE, ...)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>x</b> is the input vector.</p></li>
<li><p><b>trim</b> is used to drop some observations from both end of the sorted vector.</p></li>
<li><p><b>na.rm</b> is used to remove the missing values from the input vector.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector. 
x &lt;- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

# Find Mean.
result.mean &lt;- mean(x)
print(result.mean)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 8.22
</pre>
<h2>Applying Trim Option</h2>
<p>When trim parameter is supplied, the values in the vector get sorted and then the required numbers of observations are dropped from calculating the mean.</p>
<p>When trim = 0.3, 3 values from each end will be dropped from the calculations to find mean.</p>
<p>In this case the sorted vector is (&minus;21, &minus;5, 2, 3, 4.2, 7, 8, 12, 18, 54) and the values removed from the vector for calculating mean are (&minus;21,&minus;5,2) from left and (12,18,54) from right.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector.
x &lt;- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5)

result.mean &lt;-  mean(x,trim = 0.3)
print(result.mean)
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
[1] 5.55
</pre>
<h2>Applying NA Option</h2>
<p>If there are missing values, then the mean function returns NA.</p>
<p>To drop the missing values from the calculation use na.rm = TRUE. which means remove the NA values.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create a vector. 
x &lt;- c(12,7,3,4.2,18,2,54,-21,8,-5,NA)

# Find mean.
result.mean &lt;-  mean(x)
print(result.mean)

# Find mean dropping NA values.
result.mean &lt;-  mean(x,na.rm = TRUE)

<h2>Median</h2>
<p>The middle most value in a data series is called the median. The <b>median()</b> function is used in R to calculate this value.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>

</pre>
<h2>Mode</h2>
<p>The mode is the value that has highest number of occurrences in a set of data. Unike mean and median, mode can have both numeric and character data.</p>
<p>R does not have a standard in-built function to calculate mode. So we create a user function to calculate mode of a data set in R. This function takes the vector as input and gives the mode value as output.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Create the function.
getmode &lt;- function(v) {
   uniqv &lt;- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

# Create the vector with numbers.
v &lt;- c(2,1,2,3,1,2,3,4,1,5,5,3,2,3)

# Calculate the mode using the user function.
result &lt;- getmode(v)
print(result)

# Create the vector with characters.
charv &lt;- c("o","it","the","it","it")

# Calculate the mode using the user function.
result &lt;- getmode(charv)

<h1>R - Linear Regression</h1>
<p>Regression analysis is a very widely used statistical tool to establish a relationship model between two variables. One of these variable is called predictor variable whose value is gathered through experiments. The other variable is called response variable whose value is derived from the predictor variable.</p>
<p>In Linear Regression these two variables are related through an equation, where exponent (power) of both these variables is 1. Mathematically a linear relationship represents a straight line when plotted as a graph. A non-linear relationship where the exponent of any variable is not equal to 1 creates a curve.</p>

<h1>R - Multiple Regression</h1>
<p>Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression into relationship between more than two variables. In simple linear relation we have one predictor and one response variable, but in multiple regression we have more than one predictor variable and one response variable.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the summary as the p-value in the last column is more than 0.05 for the variables "cyl" and "hp", we consider them to be insignificant in contributing to the value of the variable "am". Only weight (wt) impacts the "am" value in this regression model.</p>
<h1>R - Normal Distribution</h1>
<p>In a random collection of data from independent sources, it is generally observed that the distribution of data is normal. Which means, on plotting a graph with the value of the variable in the horizontal axis and the count of the values in the vertical axis we get a bell shape curve. The center of the curve represents the mean of the data set. In the graph, fifty percent of values lie to the left of the mean and the other fifty percent lie to the right of the graph. This is referred as normal distribution in statistics.</p>
<p>R has four in built functions to generate normal distribution. They are described below.</p>

<h1>R - Analysis of Covariance</h1>
<p>We use Regression analysis to create models which describe the effect of variation in predictor variables on the response variable. Sometimes, if we have a categorical variable with values like Yes/No or Male/Female etc. The simple regression analysis gives multiple results for each value of the categorical variable. In such scenario, we can study the effect of the categorical variable by using it along with the predictor variable and comparing the regression lines for each level of the categorical variable. Such an analysis is termed as <b>Analysis of Covariance</b> also called as <b>ANCOVA</b>.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the R built in data set mtcars. In it we observer that the field "am" represents the type of transmission (auto or manual). It is a categorical variable with values 0 and 1. The miles per gallon value(mpg) of a car can also depend on it besides the value of horse power("hp").</p>
<p>We study the effect of the value of "am" on the regression between "mpg" and "hp". It is done by using the <b>aov()</b> function followed by the <b>anova()</b> function to compare the multiple regressions.</p>
<h2>Input Data</h2>

<h1>R - Time Series Analysis</h1>
<p>Time series is a series of data points in which each data point is associated with a timestamp. A simple example is the price of a stock in the stock market at different points of time on a given day. Another example is the amount of rainfall in a region at different months of the year. R language uses many functions to create, manipulate and plot the time series data. The data for the time series is stored in an R object called <b>time-series object</b>. It is also a R data object like a vector or data frame.</p>
<p>The time series object is created by using the <b>ts()</b> function.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The basic syntax for <b>ts()</b> function in time series analysis is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
timeseries.object.name &lt;-  ts(data, start, end, frequency)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>data</b> is a vector or matrix containing the values used in the time series.</p></li>
<li><p><b>start</b> specifies the start time for the first observation in time series.</p></li>
<li><p><b>end</b> specifies the end time for the last observation in time series.</p></li>
<li><p><b>frequency</b> specifies the number of observations per unit time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Except the parameter "data" all other parameters are optional.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Consider the annual rainfall details at a place starting from January 2012. We create an R time series object for a period of 12 months and plot it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<h1>R - Nonlinear Least Square</h1>
<p>When modeling real world data for regression analysis, we observe that it is rarely the case that the equation of the model is a linear equation giving a linear graph. Most of the time, the equation of the model of real world data involves mathematical functions of higher degree like an exponent of 3 or a sin function. In such a scenario, the plot of the model gives a curve rather than a line. The goal of both linear and non-linear regression is to adjust the values of the model's parameters to find the line or curve that comes closest to your data. On finding these values we will be able to estimate the response variable with good accuracy.</p>
<p>In Least Square regression, we establish a regression model in which the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of different points from the regression curve is minimized. We generally start with a defined model and assume some values for the coefficients. We then apply the <b>nls()</b> function of R to get the more accurate values along with the confidence intervals.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The basic syntax for creating a nonlinear least square test in R is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
nls(formula, data, start)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>formula</b> is a nonlinear model formula including variables and parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><b>data</b> is a data frame used to evaluate the variables in the formula.</p></li>
<li><p><b>start</b> is a named list or named numeric vector of starting estimates.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We will consider a nonlinear model with assumption of initial values of its coefficients. Next we will see what is the confidence intervals of these assumed values so that we can judge how well these values fir into the model.</p>
<p>So let's consider the below equation for this purpose &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
a = b1*x^2+b2
</pre>
<p>Let's assume the initial coefficients to be 1 and 3 and fit these values into nls() function.</p>

# Plot the chart with new data by fitting it to a prediction from 100 data points.
new.data &lt;- data.frame(xvalues = seq(min(xvalues),max(xvalues),len = 100))
lines(new.data$xvalues,predict(model,newdata = new.data))

<h1>R - Decision Tree</h1>
<p>Decision tree is a graph to represent choices and their results in form of a tree. The nodes in the graph represent an event or choice and the edges of the graph represent the decision rules or conditions. It is mostly used in Machine Learning and Data Mining applications using R.</p>
<p>Examples of use of decision tress is &minus; predicting an email as spam or not spam, predicting of a tumor is cancerous or predicting a loan as a good or bad credit risk based on the factors in each of these. Generally, a model is created with observed data also called training data. Then a set of validation data is used to verify and improve the model. R has packages which are used to create and visualize decision trees. For new set of predictor variable, we use this model to arrive at a decision on the category (yes/No, spam/not spam) of the data.</p>
<p>The R package <b>"party"</b> is used to create decision trees.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>From the decision tree shown above we can conclude that anyone whose readingSkills score is less than 38.3 and age is more than 6 is not a native Speaker.</p>
<h1>R - Random Forest</h1>
<p>In the random forest approach, a large number of decision trees are created. Every observation is fed into every decision tree. The most common outcome for each observation is used as the final output. A new observation is fed into all the trees and taking a majority vote for each classification model.</p>
<p>An error estimate is made for the cases which were not used while building the tree. That is called an <b>OOB (Out-of-bag)</b> error estimate which is mentioned as a percentage.</p>

<h1>R - Survival Analysis</h1>
<p>Survival analysis deals with predicting the time when a specific event is going to occur. It is also known as failure time analysis or analysis of time to death. For example predicting the number of days a person with cancer will survive or predicting the time when a mechanical system is going to fail.</p>
<p>The R package named <b>survival</b> is used to carry out survival analysis. This package contains the function <b>Surv()</b> which takes the input data as a R formula and creates a survival object among the chosen variables for analysis. Then we use the function <b>survfit()</b> to create a plot for the analysis.</p>

<h3>Applying Surv() and survfit() Function</h3>
<p>Now we proceed to apply the <b>Surv()</b> function to the above data set and create a plot that will show the trend.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
# Load the library.
library("survival")

# Create the survival object. 
survfit(Surv(pbc$time,pbc$status == 2)~1)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "survival.png")

# Plot the graph. 
plot(survfit(Surv(pbc$time,pbc$status == 2)~1))

# Save the file.
dev.off()
</pre>
<p>When we execute the above code, it produces the following result and chart &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<p>The trend in the above graph helps us predicting the probability of survival at the end of a certain number of days.</p>
<h1>R - Chi Square Test</h1>
<p><b>Chi-Square test</b> is a statistical method to determine if two categorical variables have a significant correlation between them. Both those variables should be from same population and they should be categorical like &minus; Yes/No, Male/Female, Red/Green etc.</p>
<p>For example, we can build a data set with observations on people's ice-cream buying pattern and try to correlate the gender of a person with the flavor of the ice-cream they prefer. If a correlation is found we can plan for appropriate stock of flavors by knowing the number of gender of people visiting.</p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The function used for performing chi-Square test is <b>chisq.test()</b>.</p> 
<p>The basic syntax for creating a chi-square test in R is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
chisq.test(data)
</pre>
<p>Following is the description of the parameters used &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>data</b> is the data in form of a table containing the count value of the variables in the observation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>We will take the Cars93 data in the "MASS" library which represents the sales of different models of car in the year 1993.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
library("MASS")
print(str(Cars93))

<p>The above result shows the dataset has many Factor variables which can be considered as categorical variables. For our model we will consider the variables "AirBags" and "Type". Here we aim to find out any significant correlation between the types of car sold and the type of Air bags it has. If correlation is observed we can estimate which types of cars can sell better with what types of air bags.</p>

# Load the library.

# Create a table with the needed variables.
car.data = table(Cars93$AirBags, Cars93$Type)

<p>R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team. R is freely available under the GNU General Public License, and pre-compiled binary versions are provided for various operating systems like Linux, Windows and Mac. This programming language was named R based on the first letter of first name of the two R authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the Bell Labs language S.</p>
