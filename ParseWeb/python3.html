<h1>Python 3 Tutorial</h1>

<p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ and not after Python-the snake. </p>

<p> Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Although this version is supposed to be backward incompatibles, later on many of its important features have been backported to be compatible with version 2.7.This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python 3 version programming language. Please refer to <a href="/python/index.htm" target="_blank">this link</a> for our Python 2 tutorial.</p>

<h1>Audience</h1>

<p>This tutorial is designed for software programmers who want to upgrade their Python skills to Python 3. This tutorial can also be used to learn Python programming language from scratch.</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.</p>

<title>What is New in Python 3</title>

<h1>What is New in Python 3</h1>

<h2>The __future__ module</h2>

<p>For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the following import statement.</p>

<h2>The print Function</h2>

<p>Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the <b>print</b> function is used. Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.</p>

<p>The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end =' '" appends space instead of newline.</p>

<h2>Reading Input from Keyboard</h2>

<p>Python 2 has two versions of input functions, <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b>. The input() function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the data is treated as number.</p>

<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always treated as string.</p>

<h2>Integer Division</h2>

<p>In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will result in 1.5</p>

<p>Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.</p>

<h2>Unicode Representation</h2>

<p>Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. </p>

<p>Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 byte classes: byte and byte arrays.</p>

<h2>xrange() Function Removed</h2>

<p>In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate the items in the range when needed, saving memory.</p>

<p>In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later.</p>

<h2>raise exceprion</h2>

<p>Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.</p>

<h2>Arguments in Exceptions</h2>

<p>In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.</p>

<h2>next() Function and .next() Method</h2>

<p>In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 as a generator method is discontinued and raises <b>AttributeError</b>.</p>

<h2>2to3 Utility</h2>

<p>Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid Python 3.x code.</p>

<title>Python 3 Overview</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Overview</h1>

<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

<p><b>Python is Interpreted</b> &minus; Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p>

<p><b>Python is Interactive</b> &minus; You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p>

<p><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> &minus; Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p>

<p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> &minus; Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>

<h2>History of Python</h2>

<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>

<p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>

<p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

<p>Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of Python 3.</p>

<h2>Python Features</h2>

<p>Python's features include &minus;</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-learn</b> &minus; Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows a student to pick up the language quickly.</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-read</b> &minus; Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-maintain</b> &minus; Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</p>

<p><b>A broad standard library</b> &minus; Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p>

<p><b>Interactive Mode</b> &minus; Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</p>

<p><b>Portable</b> &minus; Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</p>

<p><b>Extendable</b> &minus; You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</p>

<p><b>Databases</b> &minus; Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</p>

<p><b>GUI Programming</b> &minus; Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</p>

<p><b>Scalable</b> &minus; Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p>

<p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features. A, few are listed below &minus;</p>

<p>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</p>

<p>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p>

<p>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</p>

<p>It supports automatic garbage collection.</p>

<p>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p>

<p>For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find a <b>Try it</b> option on our website code sections, at the top right corner that will take you to the online compiler. Just use it and enjoy your learning.</p>

<p>Python 3 is available for Windows, Mac OS and most of the flavors of Linux operating system. Even though Python 2 is available for many other OSs, Python 3 support either has not been made available for them or has been dropped.</p>

<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>

<p>Open a terminal window and type "python" to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.</p>

<h2>Getting Python</h2>

<h3>Windows platform</h3>

<p>Binaries of latest version of Python 3 (Python 3.5.1) are available on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">this download page</a></p>

<p>The following different installation options are available.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to install Python 3.5.1, minimum OS requirements are Windows 7 with SP1. For versions 3.0 to 3.4.x Windows XP is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Linux platform</h3>

<p>Different flavors of Linux use different package managers for installation of new packages.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu Linux, Python 3 is installed using the following command from the terminal.</p>

<p>Installation from source</p>

<p>Download Gzipped source tarball from Python's download URL &minus; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz</a></p>

<h3>Mac OS</h3>

<p>Download Mac OS installers from this URL &minus; <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/</a></p>

<p>Double click this package file and follow the wizard instructions to install.</p>

<p>The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the official website of Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>Python Official Website</b> &minus; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

<p>You can download Python documentation from the following site. The documentation is available in HTML, PDF and PostScript formats.</p>

<h2>Setting up PATH</h2>

<p>Programs and other executable files can be in many directories. Hence, the operating systems provide a search path that lists the directories that it searches for executables.</p>

<p>The important features are &minus;</p>

<p>The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintained by the operating system. This variable contains information available to the command shell and other programs.</p>

<p>The path variable is named as <b>PATH</b> in Unix or <b>Path</b> in Windows (Unix is case-sensitive; Windows is not).</p>

<p>In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Python interpreter from any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path.</p>

<h2>Setting Path at Unix/Linux</h2>

<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Unix &minus;</p>

<p><b>In the csh shell</b> &minus; type setenv PATH "$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>In the bash shell (Linux)</b> &minus; type export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/bin/python3.4 and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>In the sh or ksh shell</b> &minus; type PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>Note &minus; </b> /usr/local/bin/python3 is the path of the Python directory.</p>

<h2>Setting Path at Windows</h2>

<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Windows &minus;</p>

<p><b>At the command prompt</b> &minus; type path %path%;C:\Python and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; C:\Python is the path of the Python directory </p>

<h2>Python Environment Variables</h2>

<p>Here are important environment variables, which are recognized by Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>PYTHONPATH</b></p><p>It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONSTARTUP</b></p><p>It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONCASEOK</b></p><p>It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONHOME</b></p><p>It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.</p>

<h2>Running Python</h2>

<p>There are three different ways to start Python &minus;</p>

<h3>Interactive Interpreter</h3>

<p>You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.</p>

<p>Enter <b>python</b> the command line.</p>

<p>Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter.</p>

<p>Here is the list of all the available command line options &minus;</p>

<p><b>-d</b></p><p>provide debug output</p>

<p><b>-O</b></p><p>generate optimized bytecode (resulting in .pyo files)</p>

<p><b>-S</b></p><p>do not run import site to look for Python paths on startup</p>

<p><b>-v</b></p><p>verbose output (detailed trace on import statements)</p>

<p><b>-X</b></p><p>disable class-based built-in exceptions (just use strings); obsolete starting with version 1.6</p>

<p><b>-c cmd</b></p><p>run Python script sent in as cmd string</p>

<p><b>file</b></p><p>run Python script from given file</p>

<h3>Script from the Command-line</h3>

<p>A Python script can be executed at the command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as shown in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Be sure the file permission mode allows execution.</p>

<h3>Integrated Development Environment</h3>

<p>You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.</p>

<p><b>Unix</b> &minus; IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.</p>

<p><b>Windows</b> &minus; <b>PythonWin</b> is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.</p>

<p><b>Macintosh</b> &minus; The Macintosh version of Python  along with the IDLE IDE is available from the main website, downloadable as either MacBinary or BinHex'd files.</p>

<p>If you are not able to set up the environment properly, then you can take the help of your system admin. Make sure the Python environment is properly set up and working perfectly fine.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; All the examples given in subsequent chapters are executed with Python 3.4.1 version available on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<p>We have already set up Python Programming environment online, so that you can execute all the available examples online while you are learning theory. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

<title>Python 3 Basic Syntax</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>

<h2>First Python Program</h2>

<p>Let us execute the programs in different modes of programming.</p>

<h3>Interactive Mode Programming</h3>

<p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt &minus;</p>

<p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press Enter &minus;</p>

<p>If you are running the older version of Python (Python 2.x), use of parenthesis as <b>inprint</b> function is optional. This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Script Mode Programming</h3>

<p>Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>

<p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have the extension <b>.py</b>. Type the following source code in a test.py file &minus;</p>

<p>We assume that you have the Python interpreter set in <b>PATH</b> variable. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>On Linux</b></p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>On Windows</b></p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let us try another way to execute a Python script in Linux. Here is the modified test.py file &minus;</p>

<p>We assume that you have Python interpreter available in the /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Python Identifiers</h2>

<p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>

<p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in Python.</p>

<p>Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</p>

<p>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.</p>

<p>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.</p>

<p>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.</p>

<h2>Reserved Words</h2>

<p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>

<h2>Lines and Indentation</h2>

<p>Python does not use braces({}) to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example &minus;</p>

<p>However, the following block generates an error &minus;</p>

<p>Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with the same number of spaces would form a block. The following example has various statement blocks &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Do not try to understand the logic at this point of time. Just make sure you understood the various blocks even if they are without braces.</p>

<h2>Multi-Line Statements</h2>

<p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python, however, allows the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example &minus;</p>

<p>The statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Quotation in Python</h2>

<p>Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>

<p>The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal &minus;</p>

<h2>Comments in Python</h2>

<p>A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal is the beginning of a comment. All characters after the #, up to the end of the physical line, are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can type a comment on the same line after a statement or expression &minus;</p>

<p>Python does not have multiple-line commenting feature. You have to comment each line individually as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Using Blank Lines</h2>

<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and Python totally ignores it.</p>

<p>In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to terminate a multiline statement.</p>

<h2>Waiting for the User</h2>

<p>The following line of the program displays the prompt and, the statement saying “Press the enter key to exit”, and then waits for the user to take action &minus;</p>

<p>Here, "\n\n" is used to create two new lines before displaying the actual line. Once the user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console window open until the user is done with an application.</p>

<h2>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h2>

<p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on a single line given that no statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Statement Groups as Suites</h2>

<p>Groups of individual statements, which make a single code block are called <b>suites</b> in Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.</p>

<p>Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : ) and are followed by one or more lines which make up the suite. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Command Line Arguments</h2>

<p>Many programs can be run to provide you with some basic information about how they should be run. Python enables you to do this with -<b>h</b> &minus;</p>

<p>You can also program your script in such a way that it should accept various options. <a href="/python3/python_command_line_arguments.htm">Command Line Arguments</a> is an advanced topic. Let us understand it.</p>

<title>Python 3 Variable Types</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Variable Types</h1>

<p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.</p>

<p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>

<h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>

<p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>

<p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and  "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Assignment</h2>

<p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>

<h2>Standard Data Types</h2>

<p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>

<p>Python has five standard data types &minus;</p>

<p>Numbers</p>

<p>String</p>

<p>List</p>

<p>Tuple</p>

<p>Dictionary</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_numbers.htm">Python Numbers</a></h2>

<p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>

<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>

<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>Python supports three different numerical types &minus;</p>

<p>int (signed integers)</p>

<p>float (floating point real values)</p>

<p>complex (complex numbers)</p>

<p>All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type as long.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of numbers &minus;</p>

<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x &plus; yj, where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_strings.htm">Python Strings</a></h2>

<p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows either pair of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.</p>

<p>The plus (&plus;) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_lists.htm">Python Lists</a></h2>

<p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One of the differences between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>

<p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (&plus;) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_tuples.htm">Python Tuples</a></h2>

<p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.</p>

<p>The main difference between lists and tuples are &minus; Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as <b>read-only</b> lists. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The following code is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, which is not allowed. Similar case is possible with lists &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_dictionary.htm">Python Dictionary</a></h2>

<p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]). For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Dictionaries have no concept of order among the elements. It is incorrect to say that the elements are "out of order"; they are simply unordered.</p>

<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you may need to perform conversions between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type-names as a function.</p>

<p>There are several built-in functions to perform conversion from one data type to another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value.</p>

<p><b>int(x [,base])</b></p>

<p>Converts x to an integer. The base specifies the base if x is a string.</p>

<p><b>float(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts x to a floating-point number.</p>

<p><b>complex(real [,imag])</b></p>

<p>Creates a complex number.</p>

<p><b>str(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts object x to a string representation.</p>

<p><b>repr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts object x to an expression string.</p>

<p><b>eval(str)</b></p>

<p>Evaluates a string and returns an object.</p>

<p><b>tuple(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a tuple.</p>

<p><b>list(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a list.</p>

<p><b>set(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a set.</p>

<p><b>dict(d)</b></p>

<p>Creates a dictionary. d must be a sequence of (key,value) tuples.</p>

<p><b>frozenset(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a frozen set.</p>

<p><b>chr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a character.</p>

<p><b>unichr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a Unicode character.</p>

<p><b>ord(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts a single character to its integer value.</p>

<p><b>hex(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.</p>

<p><b>oct(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to an octal string.</p>

<p>Python supports three different numerical types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>int (signed integers)</p></li>

<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x &plus; yj, where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.</p>
<h2><a href="/python3/python_strings.htm">Python Strings</a></h2>
<p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows either pair of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.</p>
<p>The plus (&plus;) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

str = 'Hello World!'

print (str)          # Prints complete string
print (str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print (str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print (str &plus; "TEST") # Prints concatenated string

<h2><a href="/python3/python_lists.htm">Python Lists</a></h2>
<p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One of the differences between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>
<p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (&plus;) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print (list)          # Prints complete list
print (list[0])       # Prints first element of the list
print (list[1:3])     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print (list[2:])      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print (tinylist * 2)  # Prints list two times
print (list &plus; tinylist) # Prints concatenated lists

<title>Python 3 Basic Operators</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Basic Operators</h1>

<p>Operators are the constructs, which can manipulate the value of operands. Consider the expression 4 &plus; 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called the operands and &plus; is called the operator.</p>

<h2>Python Bitwise Operators</h2>

<p>Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>a = 0011 1100</p>

<p>b = 0000 1101</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>a&amp;b = 0000 1100</p>

<p>a|b = 0011 1101</p>

<p>a^b = 0011 0001</p>

<p>~a = 1100 0011</p>

<p>Python's built-in function bin() can be used to obtain binary representation of an integer number. </p>

<title>Python 3 Decision Making</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision-making is the anticipation of conditions occurring during the execution of a program and specified actions taken according to the conditions.</p>

<p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions, which produce TRUE or FALSE as the outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if the outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>Python programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and <b>non-null</b> values as TRUE, and any <b>zero</b> or <b>null values</b> as FALSE value.</p>

<p>Python programming language provides the following types of decision-making statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if statement</b> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if statement</b> can be followed by an optional <b>else statement</b>, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.</p>

<p>You can use one <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement inside another <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement(s).</p>

<p>Let us go through each decision-making statement quickly.</p>

<h2>Single Statement Suites</h2>

<p>If the suite of an <b>if</b> clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as the header statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a <b>one-line if</b> clause &minus;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
var = 100
if ( var  == 100 ) : print ("Value of expression is 100")
print ("Good bye!")
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of expression is 100
Good bye!
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Loops</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Loops</h1>

<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially &minus; The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement &minus;</p>

<p>Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>

<p>You can use one or more loop inside any another while, or for loop.</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>The Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When the execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>Python supports the following control statements.</p>

<p>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>

<p>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</p>

<p>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p>

<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly.</p>

<h2>Iterator and Generator</h2>

<p><b>Iterator</b> is an object which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a collection, regardless of its specific implementation. In Python, an iterator object implements two methods, <b>iter()</b> and <b>next()</b>.</p>

<p>String, List or Tuple objects can be used to create an Iterator.</p>

<p>A <b>generator</b> is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.</p>

<p>When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution of the function. When the next() method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. The yield keeps track i.e. remembers the last execution and the second next() call continues from previous value.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example defines a generator, which generates an iterator for all the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
list = [1,2,3,4]
it = iter(list) # this builds an iterator object
print (next(it)) #prints next available element in iterator
Iterator object can be traversed using regular for statement
!usr/bin/python3
for x in it:
   print (x, end=" ")
or using next() function
while True:
   try:
      print (next(it))
   except StopIteration:
      sys.exit() #you have to import sys module for this

<title>Python 3 Numbers</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Numbers</h1>

<p>Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types. This means, changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.</p>

<p>Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>

<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>

<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Python supports  different numerical types &minus;</p>

<p><b>complex (complex numbers)</b> &minus; are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.</p>

<p>It is possible to represent an integer in hexa-decimal or octal form</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of numbers.</p>

<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by a &plus; bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the complex number.</p>

<h2>Number Type Conversion</h2>

<p>Python converts numbers internally in an expression containing mixed types to a common type for evaluation. Sometimes, you need to coerce a number explicitly from one type to another to satisfy the requirements of an operator or function parameter.</p>

<p>Type <b>int(x)</b> to convert x to a plain integer.</p>

<p>Type <b>long(x)</b> to convert x to a long integer.</p>

<p>Type <b>float(x)</b> to convert x to a floating-point number.</p>

<p>Type <b>complex(x)</b> to convert x to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part zero.</p>

<p>Type <b>complex(x, y)</b> to convert x and y to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y. x and y are numeric expressions</p>

<h2>Mathematical Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following functions that perform mathematical calculations.</p>

<p>The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.</p>

<p>The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x.</p>

<p>cmp(x, y)</p>

<p>-1 if x &lt; y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x &gt; y. <b>Deprecated</b> in Python 3. Instead use <b> return (x&gt;y)-(x&lt;y)</b>.</p>

<p>The exponential of x: e<sup>x</sup></p>

<p>The absolute value of x.</p>

<p>The floor of x: the largest integer not greater than x.</p>

<p>The natural logarithm of x, for x &gt; 0.</p>

<p>The base-10 logarithm of x for x &gt; 0.</p>

<p>The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity</p>

<p>The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity.</p>

<p>The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple. Both parts have the same sign as x. The integer part is returned as a float.</p>

<p>The value of x**y.</p>

<p><b>x</b> rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0.</p>

<p>The square root of x for x &gt; 0.</p>

<h2>Random Number Functions</h2>

<p>Random numbers are used for games, simulations, testing, security, and privacy applications. Python includes the following functions that are commonly used.</p>

<p>A random item from a list, tuple, or string.</p>

<p>A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).</p>

<p>A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1</p>

<p>Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Returns None.</p>

<p>Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns None.</p>

<p>A random float r, such that x is less than or equal to r and r is less than y.</p>

<h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following functions that perform trigonometric calculations.</p>

<p>Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return the arc sine of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return atan(y / x), in radians.</p>

<p>Return the cosine of x radians.</p>

<p>Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y).</p>

<p>Return the sine of x radians.</p>

<p>Return the tangent of x radians.</p>

<p>Converts angle x from radians to degrees.</p>

<p>Converts angle x from degrees to radians.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Constants</h2>

<title>Python 3 Strings</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Strings</h1>

<p>Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Strings</h2>

<p>Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.</p>

<p>To access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain your substring. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Strings</h2>

<p>You can "update" an existing string by (re)assigning a variable to another string. The new value can be related to its previous value or to a completely different string altogether. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Escape Characters</h2>

<p>Following table is a list of escape or non-printable characters that can be represented with backslash notation.</p>

<p>An escape character gets interpreted; in a single quoted as well as double quoted strings.</p>

<h2>String Special Operators</h2>

<p>Assume string variable <b>a</b> holds 'Hello' and variable <b>b</b> holds 'Python', then &minus;</p>

<h2>String Formatting Operator</h2>

<p>One of Python's coolest features is the string format operator %. This operator is unique to strings and makes up for the pack of having functions from C's printf() family. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the list of complete set of symbols which can be used along with % &minus;</p>

<p><b>%c</b></p><p>character</p>

<p><b>%s</b></p><p>string conversion via str() prior to formatting</p>

<p><b>%i</b></p><p>signed decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%d</b></p><p>signed decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%u</b></p><p>unsigned decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%o</b></p><p>octal integer</p>

<p><b>%x</b></p><p>hexadecimal integer (lowercase letters)</p>

<p><b>%X</b></p>

<p><b>%e</b></p><p>exponential notation (with lowercase 'e')</p>

<p><b>%E</b></p><p>exponential notation (with UPPERcase 'E')</p>

<p><b>%f</b></p><p>floating point real number</p>

<p><b>%g</b></p><p>the shorter of %f and %e</p>

<p><b>%G</b></p><p>the shorter of %f and %E</p>

<p>Other supported symbols and functionality are listed in the following table &minus;</p>

<p><b>*</b></p>

<p>argument specifies width or precision</p>

<p><b>-</b></p>

<p>left justification</p>

<p><b>&plus;</b></p>

<p>display the sign</p>

<p><b>&lt;sp&gt;</b></p>

<p>leave a blank space before a positive number</p>

<p><b>#</b></p>

<p>add the octal leading zero ( '0' ) or hexadecimal leading '0x' or '0X', depending on whether 'x' or 'X' were used.</p>

<p><b>0</b></p>

<p>pad from left with zeros (instead of spaces)</p>

<p><b>%</b></p>

<p>'%%' leaves you with a single literal '%'</p>

<p><b>(var)</b></p>

<p>mapping variable (dictionary arguments)</p>

<p><b>m.n.</b></p>

<p>m is the minimum total width and n is the number of digits to display after the decimal point (if appl.)</p>

<h2>Triple Quotes</h2>

<p>Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines, including verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.</p>

<p>The syntax for triple quotes consists of three consecutive <b>single or double</b> quotes.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result. Note how every single special character has been converted to its printed form, right down to the last NEWLINE at the end of the string between the "up." and closing triple quotes. Also note that NEWLINEs occur either with an explicit carriage return at the end of a line or its escape code (\n) &minus;</p>

<p>Raw strings do not treat the backslash as a special character at all. Every character you put into a raw string stays the way you wrote it &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Now let's make use of raw string. We would put expression in <b>r'expression'</b> as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Unicode String</h2>

<p>In Python 3, all strings are represented in Unicode.In Python 2 are stored internally as 8-bit ASCII, hence it is required to attach 'u' to make it Unicode. It is no longer necessary now.</p>

<h3>Built-in String Methods</h3>

<p>Python includes the following built-in methods to manipulate strings &minus;</p>

<p>Capitalizes first letter of string</p>

<p>Returns a string padded with <i>fillchar</i></em> with the original string centered to a total of <i>width</i> columns.</p>

<p>Counts how many times str occurs in string or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given.</p>

<p>Decodes the string using the codec registered for encoding. encoding defaults to the default string encoding.</p>

<p>Returns encoded string version of string; on error, default is to raise a ValueError unless errors is given with 'ignore' or 'replace'.</p>

<p>Determines if string or a substring of string (if starting index beg and ending index end are given) ends with suffix; returns true if so and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Expands tabs in string to multiple spaces; defaults to 8 spaces per tab if tabsize not provided.</p>

<p>Determine if str occurs in string or in a substring of string if starting index beg and ending index end are given returns index if found and -1 otherwise.</p>

<p>Same as find(), but raises an exception if str not found.</p>

<p>Returns true if string has at least 1 character and all characters are alphanumeric and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string has at least 1 character and all characters are alphabetic and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string contains only digits and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string has at least 1 cased character and all cased characters are in lowercase and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if a unicode string contains only numeric characters and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string contains only whitespace characters and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string is properly "titlecased" and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Returns true if string has at least one cased character and all cased characters are in uppercase and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Merges (concatenates) the string representations of elements in sequence seq into a string, with separator string.</p>

<p>Returns the length of the string</p>

<p>Returns a space-padded string with the original string left-justified to a total of width columns.</p>

<p>Converts all uppercase letters in string to lowercase.</p>

<p>Removes all leading whitespace in string.</p>

<p>Returns a translation table to be used in translate function.</p>

<p>Returns the max alphabetical character from the string str.</p>

<p>Returns the min alphabetical character from the string str.</p>

<p>Replaces all occurrences of old in string with new or at most max occurrences if max given.</p>

<p>Same as find(), but search backwards in string.</p>

<p>Same as index(), but search backwards in string.</p>

<p>Returns a space-padded string with the original string right-justified to a total of width columns.</p>

<p>Removes all trailing whitespace of string.</p>

<p>Splits string according to delimiter str (space if not provided) and returns list of substrings; split into at most num substrings if given.</p>

<p>Splits string at all (or num) NEWLINEs and returns a list of each line with NEWLINEs removed.</p>

<p>Determines if string or a substring of string (if starting index beg and ending index end are given) starts with substring str; returns true if so and false otherwise.</p>

<p>Performs both lstrip() and rstrip() on string</p>

<p>Inverts case for all letters in string.</p>

<p>Returns "titlecased" version of string, that is, all words begin with uppercase and the rest are lowercase.</p>

<p>Translates string according to translation table str(256 chars), removing those in the del string.</p>

<p>Converts lowercase letters in string to uppercase.</p>

<p>Returns original string leftpadded with zeros to a total of width characters; intended for numbers, zfill() retains any sign given (less one zero).</p>

<p>Returns true if a unicode string contains only decimal characters and false otherwise.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Strings</h2>
<p>Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.</p>
<p>To access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain your substring. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

var1 = 'Hello World!'
var2 = "Python Programming"

print ("var1[0]: ", var1[0])
print ("var2[1:5]: ", var2[1:5])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
var1[0]:  H
var2[1:5]:  ytho
</pre>
<h2>Updating Strings</h2>
<p>You can "update" an existing string by (re)assigning a variable to another string. The new value can be related to its previous value or to a completely different string altogether. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

var1 = 'Hello World!'

print ("Updated String :- ", var1[:6] + 'Python')
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Updated String :-  Hello Python

<title>Python 3 Lists</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Lists</h1>

<p>The most basic data structure in Python is the <b>sequence</b>. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.</p>

<p>Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.</p>

<p>There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.</p>

<h2>Python Lists</h2>

<p>The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that the items in a list need not be of the same type.</p>

<p>Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be sliced, concatenated and so on.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Lists</h2>

<p>To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Lists</h2>

<p>You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append() method. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete List Elements</h2>

<p>To remove a list element, you can use either the <b>del</b> statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting. You can use the remove() method if you do not know exactly which items to delete. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>

<h2>Basic List Operations</h2>

<p>Lists respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.</p>

<p>In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior chapter.</p>

<h2>Indexing, Slicing and Matrixes</h2>

<p>Since lists are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for lists as they do for strings.</p>

<p>Assuming the following input &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Built-in List Functions and Methods</h2>

<p>Python includes the following list functions &minus;</p>

<p>No longer available in Python 3.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the list.</p>

<p>Returns item from the list with max value.</p>

<p>Returns item from the list with min value.</p>

<p>Converts a tuple into list.</p>

<p>Python includes the following list methods &minus;</p>

<p>Appends object obj to list</p>

<p>Returns count of how many times obj occurs in list</p>

<p>Appends the contents of seq to list</p>

<p>Returns the lowest index in list that obj appears</p>

<p>Inserts object obj into list at offset index</p>

<p>Removes and returns last object or obj from list</p>

<p>Removes object obj from list</p>

<p>Reverses objects of list in place</p>

<p>Sorts objects of list, use compare func if given</p>

<h2>Delete List Elements</h2>
<p>To remove a list element, you can use either the <b>del</b> statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting. You can use the remove() method if you do not know exactly which items to delete. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The main difference between the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists. Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.</p>

<p>Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally, you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example &minus;</p>

<p>The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing &minus;</p>

<p>To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value &minus;</p>

<p>Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Tuples</h2>

<p>To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain the value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Tuples</h2>

<p>Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example demonstrates &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete Tuple Elements</h2>

<p>Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.</p>

<p>To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; An exception is raised. This is because after <b>del tup</b>, tuple does not exist any more.</p>

<h2>Basic Tuples Operations</h2>

<p>Tuples respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.</p>

<p>In fact, tuples respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the previous chapter.</p>

<h2>Indexing, Slicing, and Matrixes</h2>

<p>Since tuples are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for tuples as they do for strings, assuming the following input &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<h2>No Enclosing Delimiters</h2>

<p>No enclosing Delimiters is any set of multiple objects, comma-separated, written without identifying symbols, i.e., brackets for lists, parentheses for tuples, etc., default to tuples, as indicated in these short examples.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Built-in Tuple Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following tuple functions &minus;</p>

<p>Compares elements of both tuples.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the tuple.</p>

<p>Returns item from the tuple with max value.</p>

<p>Returns item from the tuple with min value.</p>

<p>Converts a list into tuple.</p>

<title>Python 3 Dictionary</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Dictionary</h1>

<p>Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.</p>

<p>Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Dictionary</h2>

<p>To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>If we attempt to access a data item with a key, which is not a part of the dictionary, we get an error as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Dictionary</h2>

<p>You can update a dictionary by adding a new entry or a key-value pair, modifying an existing entry, or deleting an existing entry as shown in a simple example given below.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete Dictionary Elements</h2>

<p>You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.</p>

<p>To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the <b>del</b> statement. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result.</p>

<p>An exception is raised because after <b>del dict</b>, the dictionary does not exist anymore.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The del() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>

<h2>Properties of Dictionary Keys</h2>

<p>Dictionary values have no restrictions. They can be any arbitrary Python object, either standard objects or user-defined objects. However, same is not true for the keys.</p>

<p>There are two important points to remember about dictionary keys &minus;</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> More than one entry per key is not allowed. This means no duplicate key is allowed. When duplicate keys are encountered during assignment, the last assignment wins. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Keys must be immutable. This means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Built-in Dictionary Functions and Methods</h2>

<p>Python includes the following dictionary functions &minus;</p>

<p>No longer available in Python 3.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the dictionary. This would be equal to the number of items in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Produces a printable string representation of a dictionary</p>

<p>Returns the type of the passed variable. If passed variable is dictionary, then it would return a dictionary type.</p>

<p>Python includes the following dictionary methods &minus;</p>

<p>Removes all elements of dictionary <i>dict</i></p>

<p>Returns a shallow copy of dictionary <i>dict</i></p>

<p> Create a new dictionary with keys from seq and values <i>set</i> to <i>value</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>key</i> key, returns value or default if key not in dictionary</p>

<p>Removed, use the <i>in</i> operation instead.</p>

<p>Returns a list of <i>dict</i>'s (key, value) tuple pairs</p>

<p>Returns list of dictionary dict's keys</p>

<p>Similar to get(), but will set dict[key] = default if <i>key</i> is not already in dict</p>

<p>Adds dictionary <i>dict2</i>'s key-values pairs to <i>dict</i></p>

<p>Returns list of dictionary <i>dict</i>'s values</p>

<title>Python 3 Date and Time</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Date &amp; Time</h1>

<p>A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.</p>

<h2>What is Tick?</h2>

<p>Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds. Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>

<p>There is a popular <b>time</b> module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. The function <b>time.time()</b> returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This would produce a result something as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be represented in this form. Dates in the far future also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.</p>

<h2>What is TimeTuple?</h2>

<p>Many of the Python's time functions handle time as a tuple of 9 numbers, as shown below &minus;</p>

<p>For Example &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce a result as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The above tuple is equivalent to <b>struct_time</b> structure. This structure has following attributes &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting current time</h2>

<p>To translate a time instant from seconds since the epoch floating-point value into a timetuple, pass the floating-point value to a function (e.g., localtime) that returns a time-tuple with all valid nine items.</p>

<p>This would produce the following result, which could be formatted in any other presentable form &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting formatted time</h2>

<p>You can format any time as per your requirement, but a simple method to get time in a readable format is <b>asctime()</b> &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting calendar for a month</h2>

<p>The calendar module gives a wide range of methods to play with yearly and monthly calendars. Here, we print a calendar for a given month ( Jan 2008 ) &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The time Module</h2>

<p>There is a popular <b>time</b> module available in Python, which provides functions for working with times and for converting between representations. Here is the list of all available methods.</p>

<p>The offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is defined. This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as in Western Europe, including the UK). Use this if the daylight is nonzero.</p>

<p>Accepts a time-tuple and returns a readable 24-character string such as 'Tue Dec 11 18:07:14 2008'.</p>

<p>Returns the current CPU time as a floating-point number of seconds. To measure computational costs of different approaches, the value of time.clock is more useful than that of time.time().</p>

<p>Like asctime(localtime(secs)) and without arguments is like asctime( )</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed in seconds since the epoch and returns a time-tuple t with the UTC time. Note &minus; t.tm_isdst is always 0</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed in seconds since the epoch and returns a time-tuple t with the local time (t.tm_isdst is 0 or 1, depending on whether DST applies to instant secs by local rules).</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed as a time-tuple in local time and returns a floating-point value with the instant expressed in seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>Suspends the calling thread for secs seconds.</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed as a time-tuple in local time and returns a string representing the instant as specified by string fmt.</p>

<p>Parses str according to format string fmt and returns the instant in time-tuple format.</p>

<p>Returns the current time instant, a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>Resets the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment variable TZ specifies how this is done.</p>

<p>There are two important attributes available with time module. They are &minus;</p>

<p><b>time.timezone</b></p>

<p>Attribute time.timezone is the offset in seconds of the local time zone (without DST) from UTC (&gt;0 in the Americas; &lt;=0 in most of Europe, Asia, Africa).</p>

<p><b>time.tzname</b></p>

<p>Attribute time.tzname is a pair of locale-dependent strings, which are the names of the local time zone without and with DST, respectively.</p>

<h2>The calendar Module</h2>

<p>The calendar module supplies calendar-related functions, including functions to print a text calendar for a given month or year.</p>

<p> By default, calendar takes Monday as the first day of the week and Sunday as the last one. To change this, call the <b>calendar.setfirstweekday()</b> function.</p>

<p>Here is a list of functions available with the <b>calendar</b> module &minus;</p>

<p><b>calendar.calendar(year,w = 2,l = 1,c = 6)</b></p>

<p>Returns a multiline string with a calendar for year year formatted into three columns separated by c spaces. w is the width in characters of each date; each line has length 21*w&plus;18&plus;2*c. l is the number of lines for each week.</p>

<p><b>calendar.firstweekday( )</b></p>

<p>Returns the current setting for the weekday that starts each week. By default, when calendar is first imported, this is 0, meaning Monday.</p>

<p><b>calendar.isleap(year)</b></p>

<p>Returns True if year is a leap year; otherwise, False.</p>

<p><b>calendar.leapdays(y1,y2)</b></p>

<p>Returns the total number of leap days in the years within range(y1,y2).</p>

<p><b>calendar.month(year,month,w = 2,l = 1)</b></p>

<p>Returns a multiline string with a calendar for month month of year year, one line per week plus two header lines. w is the width in characters of each date; each line has length 7*w&plus;6. l is the number of lines for each week.</p>

<p><b>calendar.monthcalendar(year,month)</b></p>

<p>Returns a list of lists of ints. Each sublist denotes a week. Days outside month month of year year are set to 0; days within the month are set to their day-of-month, 1 and up.</p>

<p><b>calendar.monthrange(year,month)</b></p>

<p>Returns two integers. The first one is the code of the weekday for the first day of the month month in year year; the second one is the number of days in the month. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday); month numbers are 1 to 12.</p>

<p><b>calendar.prcal(year,w = 2,l = 1,c = 6)</b></p>

<p>Like print calendar.calendar(year,w,l,c).</p>

<p><b>calendar.prmonth(year,month,w = 2,l = 1)</b></p>

<p>Like print calendar.month(year,month,w,l).</p>

<p><b>calendar.setfirstweekday(weekday)</b></p>

<p>Sets the first day of each week to weekday code weekday. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday).</p>

<p><b>calendar.timegm(tupletime)</b></p>

<p>The inverse of time.gmtime: accepts a time instant in time-tuple form and returns the same instant as a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p><b>calendar.weekday(year,month,day)</b></p>

<p>Returns the weekday code for the given date. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday); month numbers are 1 (January) to 12 (December).</p>

<title>Python 3 Functions</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>

<p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called <i>user-defined functions.</i></p>

<h3>Defining a Function</h3>

<p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>

<p>Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</p>

<p>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</p>

<p>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or <i>docstring</i>.</p>

<p>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</p>

<p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>

<h2>Calling a Function</h2>

<p>Defining a function gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>

<p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is an example to call the <b>printme()</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Pass by Reference vs Value</h2>

<p>All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, we are maintaining reference of the passed object and appending values in the same object. Therefore, this would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.</p>

<p>The parameter <b>mylist</b> is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect mylist. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Function Arguments</h2>

<p>You can call a function by using the following types of formal arguments &minus;</p>

<p>Required arguments</p>

<p>Keyword arguments</p>

<p>Default arguments</p>

<p>Variable-length arguments</p>

<h2>Required Arguments</h2>

<p>Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order. Here, the number of arguments in the function call should match exactly with the function definition.</p>

<p>To call the function <b>printme()</b>, you definitely need to pass one argument, otherwise it gives a syntax error as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Keyword Arguments</h2>

<p>Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.</p>

<p>This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the <b>printme()</b> function in the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The following example gives a clearer picture. Note that the order of parameters does not matter.</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Default Arguments</h2>

<p>A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. The following example gives an idea on default arguments, it prints default age if it is not passed &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Variable-length Arguments</h2>

<p>You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function. These arguments are called <i>variable-length</i> arguments and are not named in the function definition, unlike required and default arguments.</p>

<p>Syntax for a function with non-keyword variable arguments is given below &minus;</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) is placed before the variable name that holds the values of all nonkeyword variable arguments. This tuple remains empty if no additional arguments are specified during the function call. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The Anonymous Functions</h2>

<p>These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the <b>def</b> keyword. You can use the <b>lambda</b> keyword to create small anonymous functions.</p>

<p>Lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.</p>

<p>An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression.</p>

<p>Lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.</p>

<p>Although it appears that lambdas are a one-line version of a function, they are not equivalent to inline statements in C or C++, whose purpose is to stack allocation by passing function, during invocation for performance reasons.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of <b>lambda</b> functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Following is an example to show how <b>lambda</b> form of function works &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The return Statement</h2>

<p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>

<p>All the examples given below are not returning any value. You can return a value from a function as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Scope of Variables</h2>

<p>All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program. This depends on where you have declared a variable.</p>

<p>The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. There are two basic scopes of variables in Python &minus;</p>

<p>Global variables</p>

<p>Local variables</p>

<h2>Global vs. Local variables</h2>

<p>Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.</p>

<p>This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def functionname( parameters ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
</pre>
<p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print (str)
   return
</pre>
<h2>Calling a Function</h2>
<p>Defining a function gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>

   return

# Now you can call printme function
printme("This is first call to the user defined function!")
printme("Again second call to the same function")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is first call to the user defined function!

</pre>
<h2>Pass by Reference vs Value</h2>
<p>All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"
   print ("Values inside the function before change: ", mylist)
   mylist[2]=50
   print ("Values inside the function after change: ", mylist)
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30]
changeme( mylist )
print ("Values outside the function: ", mylist)
</pre>
<p>Here, we are maintaining reference of the passed object and appending values in the same object. Therefore, this would produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Values inside the function before change:  [10, 20, 30]
Values inside the function after change:  [10, 20, 50]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 50]
</pre>
<p>There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"

   print ("Values inside the function: ", mylist)
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30]
changeme( mylist )
print ("Values outside the function: ", mylist)
</pre>
<p>The parameter <b>mylist</b> is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect mylist. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Values inside the function:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30]
</pre>
<h2>Function Arguments</h2>

<title>Python 3 Modules</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Modules</h1>

<p>A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.</p>

<p>Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The Python code for a module named aname normally resides in a file namedaname.py. Here is an example of a simple module, support.py &minus;</p>

<h2>The import Statement</h2>

<p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file. The <b>import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>

<p>When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. For example, to import the module hello.py, you need to put the following command at the top of the script &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening repeatedly, if multiple imports occur.</p>

<h2>The from...import Statement</h2>

<p>Python's <b>from</b> statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The <b>from...import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>

<p>For example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following statement &minus;</p>

<h2>The from...import * Statement</h2>

<p>It is also possible to import all the names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement &minus;</p>

<p>This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.</p>

<h2>Executing Modules as Scripts</h2>

<p>Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. The code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to "__main__".</p>

<p>Add this code at the end of your module &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the above code, the following output will be displayed.</p>

<h2>Locating Modules</h2>

<p>When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences &minus;</p>

<p>The current directory.</p>

<p>If the module is not found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p>If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python3/.</p>

<p>The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the <b>sys.path</b> variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.</p>

<h2>The PYTHONPATH Variable</h2>

<p>The PYTHONPATH is an environment variable, consisting of a list of directories. The syntax of PYTHONPATH is the same as that of the shell variable PATH.</p>

<p>Here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a Windows system &minus;</p>

<p>And here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a UNIX system &minus;</p>

<h2>Namespaces and Scoping</h2>

<p>Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. A <i>namespace</i> is a dictionary of variable names (keys) and their corresponding objects (values).</p>

<p>A Python statement can access variables in a <i>local namespace</i> and in the <i>global namespace</i>. If a local and a global variable have the same name, the local variable shadows the global variable.</p>

<p>Each function has its own local namespace. Class methods follow the same scoping rule as ordinary functions.</p>

<p>Python makes educated guesses on whether variables are local or global. It assumes that any variable assigned a value in a function is local.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to assign a value to a global variable within a function, you must first use the global statement.</p>

<p>For example, we define a variable <i>Money</i> in the global namespace. Within the function Money, we assign Money a value,  therefore Python assumes Money as a local variable.</p>

<p>However, we accessed the value of the local variable <i>Money</i> before setting it, so an UnboundLocalError is the result. Uncommenting the global statement fixes the problem.</p>

<h2>The dir( ) Function</h2>

<p>The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module.</p>

<p>The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here, the special string variable __name__ is the module's name, and  __file__ is the filename from which the module was loaded.</p>

<h2>The globals() and locals() Functions</h2>

<p>The <b>globals()</b> and <b>locals()</b> functions can be used to return the names in the global and local namespaces depending on the location from where they are called.</p>

<p>If <b>locals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed locally from that function.</p>

<p>If <b>globals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed globally from that function.</p>

<p>The return type of both these functions is dictionary. Therefore, names can be extracted using the <b>keys()</b> function.</p>

<h2>The reload() Function</h2>

<p>When a module is imported into a script, the code in the top-level portion of a module is executed only once.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to reexecute the top-level code in a module, you can use the <i>reload()</i> function. The reload() function imports a previously imported module again. The syntax of the reload() function is this &minus;</p>

<p>Here, module_name is the name of the module you want to reload and not the string containing the module name. For example, to reload hello module, do the following &minus;</p>

<h2>Packages in Python</h2>

<p>A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.</p>

<p>Consider a file <i>Pots.py</i>  available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of source code &minus;</p>

<p>Similar, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above. They are &minus;</p>

<p><i>Phone/Isdn.py</i> file having function Isdn()</p>

<p><i>Phone/G3.py</i> file having function G3()</p>

<p>Now, create one more file __init__.py in the <i>Phone</i> directory &minus;</p>

<p>To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows &minus;</p>

<p>After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the above example, we have taken example of a single function in each file,  but you can keep multiple functions in your files. You can also define different Python classes in those files and then you can create your packages out of those classes.</p>

<h2>The import Statement</h2>
<p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file. The <b>import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
import module1[, module2[,... moduleN]
</pre>
<p>When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. For example, to import the module hello.py, you need to put the following command at the top of the script &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import module support
import support

# Now you can call defined function that module as follows
support.print_func("Zara")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello : Zara
</pre>
<p>A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening repeatedly, if multiple imports occur.</p>
<h2>The from...import Statement</h2>
<p>Python's <b>from</b> statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The <b>from...import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from modname import name1[, name2[, ... nameN]]
</pre>
<p>For example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n
   result = []
   a, b = 0, 1
   while b &lt; n:
      result.append(b)
      a, b = b, a + b
   return result
&gt;&gt;&gt; from fib import fib
&gt;&gt;&gt; fib(100)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
</pre>
<p>This statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol
table of the importing module.</p>
<h2>The from...import * Statement</h2>
<p>It is also possible to import all the names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from modname import *
</pre>
<p>This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.</p>
<h2>Executing Modules as Scripts</h2>
<p>Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. The code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to "__main__".</p>
<p>Add this code at the end of your module &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n
   result = []
   a, b = 0, 1
   while b &lt; n:
      result.append(b)
      a, b = b, a + b
   return result
if __name__ == "__main__":
   f = fib(100)
   print(f)
</pre>
<p>When you run the above code, the following output will be displayed.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
</pre>
<h2>Locating Modules</h2>
<p>When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The current directory.</p></li>
<li><p>If the module is not found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.</p></li>
<li><p>If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python3/.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the <b>sys.path</b> variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.</p>
<h2>The PYTHONPATH Variable</h2>
<p>The PYTHONPATH is an environment variable, consisting of a list of directories. The syntax of PYTHONPATH is the same as that of the shell variable PATH.</p>
<p>Here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a Windows system &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
set PYTHONPATH = c:\python34\lib;
</pre>
<p>And here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a UNIX system &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
set PYTHONPATH = /usr/local/lib/python
</pre>
<h2>Namespaces and Scoping</h2>
<p>Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. A <i>namespace</i> is a dictionary of variable names (keys) and their corresponding objects (values).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A Python statement can access variables in a <i>local namespace</i> and in the <i>global namespace</i>. If a local and a global variable have the same name, the local variable shadows the global variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Each function has its own local namespace. Class methods follow the same scoping rule as ordinary functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Python makes educated guesses on whether variables are local or global. It assumes that any variable assigned a value in a function is local.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, in order to assign a value to a global variable within a function, you must first use the global statement.</p></li>
<li>The statement <i>global VarName</i> tells Python that VarName is a global variable. Python stops searching the local namespace for the variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we define a variable <i>Money</i> in the global namespace. Within the function Money, we assign Money a value,  therefore Python assumes Money as a local variable.</p>
<p>However, we accessed the value of the local variable <i>Money</i> before setting it, so an UnboundLocalError is the result. Uncommenting the global statement fixes the problem.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

Money = 2000
def AddMoney():
   # Uncomment the following line to fix the code:
   # global Money
   Money = Money + 1

print (Money)
AddMoney()
print (Money)
</pre>
<h2>The dir( ) Function</h2>
<p>The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module.</p>
<p>The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import built-in module math
import math

content = dir(math)

print (content)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 'acos', 'asin', 'atan', 
'atan2', 'ceil', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'exp', 
'fabs', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'hypot', 'ldexp', 'log',
'log10', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 
'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh']
</pre>
<p>Here, the special string variable __name__ is the module's name, and  __file__ is the filename from which the module was loaded.</p>
<h2>The globals() and locals() Functions</h2>
<p>The <b>globals()</b> and <b>locals()</b> functions can be used to return the names in the global and local namespaces depending on the location from where they are called.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If <b>locals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed locally from that function.</p></li>
<li><p>If <b>globals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed globally from that function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The return type of both these functions is dictionary. Therefore, names can be extracted using the <b>keys()</b> function.</p>
<h2>The reload() Function</h2>
<p>When a module is imported into a script, the code in the top-level portion of a module is executed only once.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to reexecute the top-level code in a module, you can use the <i>reload()</i> function. The reload() function imports a previously imported module again. The syntax of the reload() function is this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
reload(module_name)
</pre>
<p>Here, module_name is the name of the module you want to reload and not the string containing the module name. For example, to reload hello module, do the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
reload(hello)
</pre>
<h2>Packages in Python</h2>
<p>A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.</p>
<p>Consider a file <i>Pots.py</i>  available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of source code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

def Pots():
print ("I'm Pots Phone")  
</pre>
<p>Similar, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><i>Phone/Isdn.py</i> file having function Isdn()</p></li>
<li><p><i>Phone/G3.py</i> file having function G3()</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, create one more file __init__.py in the <i>Phone</i> directory &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Phone/__init__.py</li>
</ul>
<p>To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from Pots import Pots
from Isdn import Isdn
from G3 import G3
</pre>
<p>After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Now import your Phone Package.
import Phone

Phone.Pots()
Phone.Isdn()
Phone.G3()
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
I'm Pots Phone
I'm 3G Phone
I'm ISDN Phone
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Files I/O</title>

<h1>Python 3  - Files I/O</h1>

<p>This chapter covers all the basic I/O functions available in Python 3. For more functions, please refer to the standard Python documentation.</p>

<h2>Printing to the Screen</h2>

<p>The simplest way to produce output is using the <i>print</i> statement where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and writes the result to standard output as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result on your standard screen &minus;</p>

<h2>Reading Keyboard Input</h2>

<p>Python 2 has two built-in functions to read data from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b></p>

<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Moreover, input() functions read data from keyboard as string, irrespective of whether it is enclosed with quotes ('' or "" ) or not.</p>

<h2>The input Function</h2>

<p>The <b>input([prompt])</b> function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes that the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.</p>

<h2>Opening and Closing Files</h2>

<p>Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.</p>

<p>Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a <b>file</b> object.</p>

<h2>The open Function</h2>

<p>Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a <b>file</b> object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here are parameter details &minus;</p>

<p><b>file_name</b> &minus; The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.</p>

<p><b>access_mode</b> &minus; The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is an optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).</p>

<p><b>buffering</b> &minus; If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering  takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).</p>

<p>Here is a list of the different modes of opening a file &minus;</p>

<p><b>r</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.</p>

<p><b>rb</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.</p>

<p><b>r&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p><b>rb&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p><b>w</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>wb</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>w&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>wb&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>a</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>ab</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>a&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>ab&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<h2>The file Object Attributes</h2>

<p>Once a file is opened and you have one <i>file</i> object, you can get various information related to that file.</p>

<p>Here is a list of all the attributes related to a file object &minus;</p>

<p><b>file.closed</b></p>

<p>Returns true if file is closed, false otherwise.</p>

<p><b>file.mode</b></p>

<p>Returns access mode with which file was opened.</p>

<p><b>file.name</b></p>

<p>Returns name of the file.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; softspace attribute is not supported in Python 3.x</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The close() Method</h2>

<p>The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.</p>

<p>Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Reading and Writing Files</h2>

<p>The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would see how to use <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> methods to read and write files.</p>

<h2>The write() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>write()</b> method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data and not just text.</p>

<p>The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and finally it would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have the following content &minus;</p>

<h2>The read() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>read()</b> method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data. apart from text data.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if <i>count</i> is missing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>File Positions</h2>

<p>The <i>tell()</i> method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>The <i>seek(offset[, from])</i> method changes the current file position. The <b>offset</b> argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The <b>from</b> argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.</p>

<p>If <i>from</i> is set to 0, the beginning of the file is used as the reference position. If it is set to 1, the current position is used as the reference position. If it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Renaming and Deleting Files</h2>

<p>Python <b>os</b> module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as renaming and deleting files.</p>

<p>To use this module, you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.</p>

<h2>The rename() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>rename()</b> method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to rename an existing file <i>test1.txt</i> &minus;</p>

<h2>The remove() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <b>remove()</b> method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be deleted as the argument.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to delete an existing file <i>test2.txt</i> &minus;</p>

<h2>Directories in Python</h2>

<p>All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these too. The <b>os</b> module has several methods that help you create, remove, and change directories.</p>

<h2>The mkdir() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <b>mkdir()</b> method of the <b>os</b> module to create directories in the current directory. You need to supply an argument to this method, which contains the name of the directory to be created.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to create a directory <i>test</i> in the current directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The chdir() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <i>chdir()</i> method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current directory.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to go into "/home/newdir" directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The getcwd() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>getcwd()</b> method displays the current working directory.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to give current directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The rmdir() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>rmdir()</b> method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method.</p>

<p>Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to remove the "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current directory.</p>

<h2>File and Directory Related Methods</h2>

<p>There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility methods to handle and manipulate files &amp; directories on Windows and Unix operating systems. They are as follows &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/file_methods.htm">File Object Methods</a></p>

<p>The <b>file</b> object provides functions to manipulate files.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/os_file_methods.htm">OS Object Methods</a></p>

<p>This provides methods to process files as well as directories.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/os_path_methods.htm">OS.Path Object Methods.</a>: This provides important functions to get information about a file or directory. </p>

<h2>The file Object Attributes</h2>
<p>Once a file is opened and you have one <i>file</i> object, you can get various information related to that file.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all the attributes related to a file object &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)
print ("Closed or not : ", fo.closed)
print ("Opening mode : ", fo.mode)
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name of the file:  foo.txt
Closed or not :  False
Opening mode :  wb

</pre>
<h2>The close() Method</h2>
<p>The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.</p>
<p>Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.close();
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name of the file:  foo.txt
</pre>
<h2>Reading and Writing Files</h2>
<p>The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would see how to use <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> methods to read and write files.</p>
<h2>The write() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>write()</b> method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data and not just text.</p>
<p>The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.write(string);
</pre>
<p>Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "w")
fo.write( "Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n")

# Close opend file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and finally it would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have the following content &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Python is a great language.
Yeah its great!!
</pre>
<h2>The read() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>read()</b> method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data. apart from text data.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.read([count]);
</pre>
<p>Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if <i>count</i> is missing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>File Positions</h2>
<p>The <i>tell()</i> method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>The <i>seek(offset[, from])</i> method changes the current file position. The <b>offset</b> argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The <b>from</b> argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.</p>
<p>If <i>from</i> is set to 0, the beginning of the file is used as the reference position. If it is set to 1, the current position is used as the reference position. If it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Check current position
position = fo.tell()
print ("Current file position : ", position)

# Reposition pointer at the beginning once again
position = fo.seek(0, 0)
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Again read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Read String is :  Python is
Current file position :  10
Again read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>Renaming and Deleting Files</h2>
<p>Python <b>os</b> module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as renaming and deleting files.</p>
<p>To use this module, you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.</p>
<h2>The rename() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>rename()</b> method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.rename(current_file_name, new_file_name)
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to rename an existing file <i>test1.txt</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Rename a file from test1.txt to test2.txt
os.rename( "test1.txt", "test2.txt" )
</pre>
<h2>The remove() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>remove()</b> method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be deleted as the argument.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.remove(file_name)
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to delete an existing file <i>test2.txt</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Delete file test2.txt
os.remove("text2.txt")
</pre>
<h2>Directories in Python</h2>
<p>All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these too. The <b>os</b> module has several methods that help you create, remove, and change directories.</p>
<h2>The mkdir() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>mkdir()</b> method of the <b>os</b> module to create directories in the current directory. You need to supply an argument to this method, which contains the name of the directory to be created.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.mkdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to create a directory <i>test</i> in the current directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Create a directory "test"
os.mkdir("test")
</pre>
<h2>The chdir() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <i>chdir()</i> method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current directory.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.chdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to go into "/home/newdir" directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Changing a directory to "/home/newdir"
os.chdir("/home/newdir")
</pre>
<h2>The getcwd() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>getcwd()</b> method displays the current working directory.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.getcwd()
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to give current directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would give location of the current directory
os.getcwd()
</pre>
<h2>The rmdir() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>rmdir()</b> method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method.</p>
<p>Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.rmdir('dirname')
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to remove the "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would  remove "/tmp/test"  directory.
os.rmdir( "/tmp/test"  )
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Exceptions Handling</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Exceptions Handling</h1>

<p>Python provides two very important features to handle any unexpected error in your Python programs and to add debugging capabilities in them &minus;</p>

<p><b>NotImplementedError</b></p>

<p>Raised when an abstract method that needs to be implemented in an inherited class is not actually implemented.</p>

<h2><a name="assertion_python">Assertions in Python</a></h2>

<p>An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.</p>

<p>The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a <b>raise-if</b> statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.</p>

<p>Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.</p>

<p>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.</p>

<h3>The assert Statement</h3>

<p>When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises an <i>AssertionError</i> exception.</p>

<p>The syntax for assert is &minus;</p>

<p>If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception, using the try-except statement. If they are not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit. Since 0° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative temperature &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>What is Exception?</h2>

<p>An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.</p>

<p>When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.</p>

<h2>Handling an exception</h2>

<p>If you have some <i>suspicious</i> code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a <b>try:</b> block. After the try: block, include an <b>except:</b> statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here is simple syntax of <i>try....except...else</i> blocks &minus;</p>

<p>Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax &minus;</p>

<p>A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.</p>

<p>You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.</p>

<p>After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.</p>

<p>The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This example opens a file, writes content in the, file and comes out gracefully because there is no problem at all &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This example tries to open a file where you do not have the write permission, so it raises an exception &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The except Clause with No Exceptions</h2>

<p>You can also use the except statement with no exceptions defined as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This kind of a <b>try-except</b> statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.</p>

<h2>The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions</h2>

<p>You can also use the same <i>except</i> statement to handle multiple exceptions as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>The try-finally Clause</h2>

<p>You can use a <b>finally:</b> block along with a <b>try:</b> block. The <b>finally:</b> block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You cannot use <i>else</i> clause as well along with a finally clause.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Same example can be written more cleanly as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When an exception is thrown in the <i>try</i> block, the execution immediately passes to the <i>finally</i> block. After all the statements in the <i>finally</i> block are executed, the exception is raised again and is handled in the <i>except</i> statements if present in the next higher layer of the <i>try-except</i> statement.</p>

<h2>Argument of an Exception</h2>

<p>An exception can have an <i>argument</i>, which is a value that gives additional information about the problem. The contents  of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable in the except clause as follows &minus;</p>

<p>If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.</p>

<p>This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error string, the error number, and an error location.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example for a single exception &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Raising an Exception</h2>

<p>You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the <b>raise</b> statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, <i>Exception</i> is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and <i>argument</i> is a value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.</p>

<p>The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above exception, we must write the except clause as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception &minus;</p>

<p>This will produce the following result</p>

<h2>User-Defined Exceptions</h2>

<p>Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.</p>

<p>Here is an example related to <i>RuntimeError</i>. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from <i>RuntimeError</i>. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.</p>

<p>In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class <i>Networkerror</i>.</p>

<p>So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows &minus;</p>

   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You cannot use <i>else</i> clause as well along with a finally clause.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
finally:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
   fh.close()
</pre>
<p>If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Error: can't find file or read data
</pre>
<p>Same example can be written more cleanly as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   try:
      fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
   finally:
      print ("Going to close the file")
      fh.close()
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
</pre>
<p>When an exception is thrown in the <i>try</i> block, the execution immediately passes to the <i>finally</i> block. After all the statements in the <i>finally</i> block are executed, the exception is raised again and is handled in the <i>except</i> statements if present in the next higher layer of the <i>try-except</i> statement.</p>
<h2>Argument of an Exception</h2>
<p>An exception can have an <i>argument</i>, which is a value that gives additional information about the problem. The contents  of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable in the except clause as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionType as Argument:
   You can print value of Argument here...
</pre>
<p>If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.</p>
<p>This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error string, the error number, and an error location.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example for a single exception &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Define a function here.
def temp_convert(var):
   try:
      return int(var)
   except ValueError as Argument:
      print ("The argument does not contain numbers\n", Argument)

# Call above function here.
temp_convert("xyz")
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The argument does not contain numbers
invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz'
</pre>
<h2>Raising an Exception</h2>
<p>You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the <b>raise</b> statement is as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
</pre>
<p>Here, <i>Exception</i> is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and <i>argument</i> is a value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.</p>
<p>The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above exception, we must write the except clause as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   Business Logic here...
except Exception as e:
   Exception handling here using e.args...
else:
   Rest of the code here...
</pre>
<p>The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level

try:
   l = functionName(-10)
   print ("level = ",l)
except Exception as e:
   print ("error in level argument",e.args[0])
</pre>
<p>This will produce the following result</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
error in level argument -10
</pre>
<h2>User-Defined Exceptions</h2>
<p>Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.</p>
<p>Here is an example related to <i>RuntimeError</i>. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from <i>RuntimeError</i>. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.</p>
<p>In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class <i>Networkerror</i>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
   def __init__(self, arg):
      self.args = arg
</pre>
<p>So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
except Networkerror,e:
   print e.args
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Object Oriented</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Object Oriented</h1>

<p>Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.</p>

<p>If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.</p>

<p>However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you &minus;</p>

<h2>Overview of OOP Terminology</h2>

<p><b>Class</b> &minus; A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </p>

<p><b>Class variable</b> &minus; A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are. </p>

<p><b>Data member</b> &minus; A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. </p>

<p><b>Function overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.</p>

<p><b>Instance variable</b> &minus; A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class. </p>

<p><b>Inheritance</b> &minus; The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it. </p>

<p><b>Instance</b> &minus;  An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</p>

<p><b>Instantiation</b> &minus; The creation of an instance of a class. </p>

<p><b>Method </b> &minus; A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</p>

<p><b>Object</b> &minus; A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. </p>

<p><b>Operator overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.</p>

<h2>Creating Classes</h2>

<p>The <i>class</i> statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword <i>class</i> followed by a colon as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via <i><b>ClassName.__doc__</b></i>.</p>

<p>The <i><b>class_suite</b></i> consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example of a simple Python class &minus;</p>

<p>The variable <i>empCount</i> is a class variable whose value is shared among all the instances of a in this class. This can be accessed as <i>Employee.empCount</i> from inside the class or outside the class.</p>

<p>The first method <i>__init__()</i> is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.</p>

<p>You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is <i>self</i>. Python adds the <i>self</i> argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods.</p>

<h2>Creating Instance Objects</h2>

<p>To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its <i>__init__</i> method accepts.</p>

<h2>Accessing Attributes</h2>

<p>You access the object's attributes using the dot operator with object. Class variable would be accessed using class name as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Now, putting all  the concepts together &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can add, remove, or modify attributes of classes and objects at any time &minus;</p>

<p>Instead of using the normal statements to access attributes, you can use the following functions &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>getattr(obj, name[, default])</b> &minus; to access the attribute of object.</p>

<p>The <b>hasattr(obj,name)</b> &minus; to check if an attribute exists or not.</p>

<p>The <b>setattr(obj,name,value)</b> &minus; to set an attribute. If attribute does not exist, then it would be created.</p>

<p>The <b>delattr(obj, name)</b> &minus; to delete an attribute.</p>

<h2>Built-In Class Attributes</h2>

<p>Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute &minus;</p>

<p><b>__dict__</b> &minus; Dictionary containing the class's namespace.</p>

<p><b>__doc__</b> &minus; Class documentation string or none, if undefined. </p>

<p><b>__name__</b> &minus; Class name. </p>

<p><b>__module__</b> &minus; Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode. </p>

<p><b>__bases__</b> &minus; A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.</p>

<p>For the above class let us try to access all these attributes &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Destroying Objects (Garbage Collection)</h2>

<p>Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is termed as Garbage Collection.</p>

<p>Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.</p>

<p>An object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object's reference count decreases when it is deleted with <i>del</i>, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python collects it automatically.</p>

<p>You normally will not notice when the garbage collector destroys an orphaned instance and reclaims its space. However, a class can implement the special method <i>__del__()</i>, called a destructor, that is invoked when the instance is about to be destroyed. This method might be used to clean up any non-memory resources used by an instance.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This __del__() destructor prints the class name of an instance that is about to be destroyed &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Ideally, you should define your classes in a separate file, then you should import them in your main program file using <i>import</i> statement.</p>

<p>In the above example, assuming definition of a Point class is contained in <i>point.py</i> and there is no other executable code in it.</p>

<h2>Class Inheritance</h2>

<p>Instead of starting from a scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a pre-existing class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.</p>

<p>The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base classes to inherit from is given after the class name &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In a similar way, you can drive a class from multiple parent classes as follows &minus;</p>

<p>You can use issubclass() or isinstance() functions to check a relationships of two classes and instances.</p>

<p>The <b>issubclass(sub, sup)</b> boolean function returns True, if the given subclass <b>sub</b> is indeed a subclass of the superclass <b>sup</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>isinstance(obj, Class)</b> boolean function returns True, if <i>obj</i> is an instance of class <i>Class</i> or is an instance of a subclass of Class</p>

<h2>Overriding Methods</h2>

<p>You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding parent's methods is that you may want special or different functionality in your subclass.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Base Overloading Methods</h2>

<p>The following table lists some generic functionality that you can override in your own classes &minus;</p>

<p><b>__init__ ( self [,args...] )</b></p>

<p>Constructor (with any optional arguments)</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>obj = className(args)</i></p>

<p><b>__del__( self )</b></p>

<p>Destructor, deletes an object</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>del obj</i></p>

<p><b>__repr__( self )</b></p>

<p>Evaluatable string representation</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>repr(obj)</i></p>

<p><b>__str__( self )</b></p>

<p>Printable string representation</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>str(obj)</i></p>

<p><b>__cmp__ ( self, x )</b></p>

<p>Object comparison</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>cmp(obj, x)</i></p>

<h2>Overloading Operators</h2>

<p>Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors. What happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.</p>

<p>You could, however, define the <i>__add__</i> method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Hiding</h2>

<p>An object's attributes may or may not be visible outside the class definition. You need to name attributes with a double underscore prefix, and those attributes then will not be directly visible to outsiders.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. You can access such attributes as <i>object._className__attrName</i>. If you would replace your last line as following, then it works for you &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<li><p>The <b>isinstance(obj, Class)</b> boolean function returns True, if <i>obj</i> is an instance of class <i>Class</i> or is an instance of a subclass of Class</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Overriding Methods</h2>
<p>You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding parent's methods is that you may want special or different functionality in your subclass.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Parent:        # define parent class
   def myMethod(self):
      print ('Calling parent method')

class Child(Parent): # define child class
   def myMethod(self):
      print ('Calling child method')

c = Child()          # instance of child
c.myMethod()         # child calls overridden method
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Calling child method
</pre>
<h2>Base Overloading Methods</h2>
<p>The following table lists some generic functionality that you can override in your own classes &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th><th style="text-align:center;">Method, Description &amp; Sample Call</th>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1</td><td><p><b>__init__ ( self [,args...] )</b></p>
<p>Constructor (with any optional arguments)</p>
<p>Sample Call : <i>obj = className(args)</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2</td><td><p><b>__del__( self )</b></p>
<p>Destructor, deletes an object</p>
<p>Sample Call : <i>del obj</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3</td><td>
<p><b>__repr__( self )</b></p>
<p>Evaluatable string representation</p> 
<p>Sample Call : <i>repr(obj)</i></p></td></tr>

<p>Sample Call : <i>str(obj)</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">5</td><td><p><b>__cmp__ ( self, x )</b></p>
<p>Object comparison</p> 
<p>Sample Call : <i>cmp(obj, x)</i></p></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Overloading Operators</h2>
<p>Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors. What happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.</p>
<p>You could, however, define the <i>__add__</i> method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Vector:
   def __init__(self, a, b):
      self.a = a
      self.b = b

   def __str__(self):
      return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)
   
   def __add__(self,other):
      return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print (v1 + v2)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Vector(7,8)
</pre>
<h2>Data Hiding</h2>
<p>An object's attributes may or may not be visible outside the class definition. You need to name attributes with a double underscore prefix, and those attributes then will not be directly visible to outsiders.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class JustCounter:
   __secretCount = 0
  
   def count(self):
      self.__secretCount += 1
      print (self.__secretCount)

counter = JustCounter()
counter.count()
counter.count()
print (counter.__secretCount)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
1
2
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
      print counter.__secretCount
AttributeError: JustCounter instance has no attribute '__secretCount'
</pre>
<p>Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. You can access such attributes as <i>object._className__attrName</i>. If you would replace your last line as following, then it works for you &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
.........................
print (counter._JustCounter__secretCount)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>Python 3 Regular Expressions</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Regular Expressions</h1>

<p>A <i>regular expression</i> is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.</p>

<p>The module <b>re</b> provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The <b>re</b> module raises the exception <b>re.error</b> if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.</p>

<p>We would cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular expressions. Nevertheless, a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have special meaning when they are used in regular expression. To avoid any confusion while dealing with regular expressions, we would use Raw Strings as <b>r'expression'</b>.</p>

<h3>Basic patterns that match single chars</h3>

<p><b>a, X, 9, &lt;</b></p>

<p>ordinary characters just match themselves exactly.</p>

<p><b>. (a period)</b></p>

<p>matches any single character except newline '\n'</p>

<p><b>\w</b></p>

<p>matches a "word" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_].</p>

<p><b>\W</b></p>

<p>matches any non-word character.</p>

<p><b>\b</b></p>

<p>boundary between word and non-word</p>

<p><b>\s</b></p>

<p>matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab</p>

<p><b>\S</b></p>

<p>matches any non-whitespace character.</p>

<p><b>\t, \n, \r</b></p>

<p>tab, newline, return</p>

<p><b>\d</b></p>

<p>decimal digit [0-9]</p>

<p><b>&#94;</b></p>

<p>matches start of the string</p>

<p><b>&dollar;</b></p>

<p>match the end of the string</p>

<p><b>\</b></p>

<p>inhibit the "specialness" of a character.</p>

<h3>Compilation flags</h3>

<p>Compilation flags let you modify some aspects of how regular expressions work. Flags are available in the re module under two names, a long name such as <b>IGNORECASE</b> and a short, one-letter form such as I.</p>

<p><b>ASCII, A</b></p>

<p>Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d match only on ASCII characters with the respective   property.</p>

<p><b>DOTALL, S</b></p>

<p>Make, match any character, including newlines</p>

<p><b>IGNORECASE, I</b></p>

<p>Do case-insensitive matches</p>

<p><b>LOCALE, L</b></p>

<p>Do a locale-aware match</p>

<p><b>MULTILINE, M</b></p>

<p>Multi-line matching, affecting &#94; and &dollar;</p>

<p><b>VERBOSE, X (for ‘extended’)</b></p>

<p>Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably</p>

<h2>The match Function</h2>

<p>This function attempts to match RE <i>pattern</i> to <i>string</i> with optional <i>flags</i>.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax for this function &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>pattern</b></p>

<p>This is the regular expression to be matched.</p>

<p><b>string</b></p>

<p>This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern at the beginning of string.</p>

<p><b>flags</b></p>

<p>You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The <i>re.match</i> function returns a <b>match</b> object on success, <b>None</b> on failure. We use<i>group(num)</i> or <i>groups()</i> function of <b>match</b> object to get matched expression.</p>

<p><b>group(num = 0)</b></p>

<p>This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num)</p>

<p><b>groups()</b></p>

<p>This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The search Function</h2>

<p>This function searches for first occurrence of RE <i>pattern</i> within <i>string</i> with optional <i>flags</i>.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax for this function &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>pattern</b></p>

<p>This is the regular expression to be matched.</p>

<p><b>string</b></p>

<p>This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern anywhere in the string.</p>

<p><b>flags</b></p>

<p>You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The <i>re.search</i> function returns a <b>match</b> object on success, <b>none</b> on failure. We use <i>group(num) </i> or <i>groups() </i> function of <b>match</b> object to get the matched expression.</p>

<p><b>group(num = 0)</b></p>

<p>This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num)</p>

<p><b>groups()</b></p>

<p>This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Matching Versus Searching</h2>

<p>Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: <b>match</b> checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while <b>search</b> checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Search and Replace</h2>

<p>One of the most important <b>re</b> methods that use regular expressions is <b>sub</b>.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>This method replaces all occurrences of the RE <i>pattern</i> in <i>string</i> with <i>repl</i>, substituting all occurrences unless <i>max</i> is provided. This method returns modified string.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Regular Expression Modifiers: Option Flags</h2>

<p>Regular expression literals may include an optional modifier to control various aspects of matching. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. You can provide multiple modifiers using exclusive OR (|), as shown previously and may be represented by one of these &minus;</p>

<p><b>re.I</b></p>

<p>Performs case-insensitive matching.</p>

<p><b>re.L</b></p>

<p>Interprets words according to the current locale. This interpretation affects the alphabetic group (\w and \W), as well as word boundary behavior (\b and \B).</p>

<p><b>re.M</b></p>

<p>Makes &dollar; match the end of a line (not just the end of the string) and makes &#94; match the start of any line (not just the start of the string).</p>

<p><b>re.S</b></p>

<p>Makes a period (dot) match any character, including a newline.</p>

<p><b>re.U</b></p>

<p>Interprets letters according to the Unicode character set. This flag affects the behavior of \w, \W, \b, \B.</p>

<p><b>re.X</b></p>

<p>Permits "cuter" regular expression syntax. It ignores whitespace (except inside a set [] or when escaped by a backslash) and treats unescaped # as a comment marker.</p>

<h2>Regular Expression Patterns</h2>

<p>Except for the control characters, <b>(&plus; ? . * &#94; &dollar; ( ) [ ] { } | \)</b>, all characters match themselves. You can escape a control character by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p>The following table lists the regular expression syntax that is available in Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>&#94;</b></p><p>Matches beginning of line.</p>

<p><b>&dollar;</b></p><p>Matches end of line.</p>

<p><b>.</b></p><p>Matches any single character except newline. Using m option allows it to match newline as well.</p>

<p><b>[...]</b></p>

<p>Matches any single character in brackets.</p>

<p><b>[&#94;...]</b></p><p>Matches any single character not in brackets</p>

<p><b>re*</b></p><p>Matches 0 or more occurrences of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>re&plus;</b></p>

<p>Matches 1 or more occurrence of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>re?</b></p><p>Matches 0 or 1 occurrence of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>re{ n}</b></p><p>Matches exactly n number of occurrences of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>re{ n,}</b></p><p>Matches n or more occurrences of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>re{ n, m}</b></p><p>Matches at least n and at most m occurrences of preceding expression.</p>

<p><b>a|b</b></p><p>Matches either a or b.</p>

<p><b>(re)</b></p><p>Groups regular expressions and remembers matched text.</p>

<p><b>(?imx)</b></p><p>Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in parentheses, only that area is affected.</p>

<p><b>(?-imx)</b></p><p>Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within a regular expression. If in parentheses, only that area is affected.</p>

<p><b>(?: re)</b></p><p>Groups regular expressions without remembering matched text.</p>

<p><b>(?imx: re)</b></p><p>Temporarily toggles on i, m, or x options within parentheses.</p>

<p><b>(?-imx: re)</b></p><p>Temporarily toggles off i, m, or x options within parentheses.</p>

<p><b>(?#...)</b></p><p>Comment.</p>

<p><b>(?= re)</b></p><p>Specifies position using a pattern. Does not have a range.</p>

<p><b>(?! re)</b></p><p>Specifies position using pattern negation. Does not have a range.</p>

<p><b>(?&gt; re)</b></p><p>Matches independent pattern without backtracking.</p>

<p><b>\w</b></p><p>Matches word characters.</p>

<p><b>\W</b></p><p>Matches nonword characters.</p>

<p><b>\s</b></p><p>Matches whitespace. Equivalent to [\t\n\r\f].</p>

<p><b>\S</b></p><p>Matches nonwhitespace.</p>

<p><b>\d</b></p><p>Matches digits. Equivalent to [0-9].</p>

<p><b>\D</b></p><p>Matches nondigits.</p>

<p><b>\A</b></p><p>Matches beginning of string.</p>

<p><b>\Z</b></p><p>Matches end of string. If a newline exists, it matches just before newline.</p>

<p><b>\z</b></p><p>Matches end of string.</p>

<p><b>\G</b></p><p>Matches point where last match finished.</p>

<p><b>\b</b></p><p>Matches word boundaries when outside brackets. Matches backspace (0x08) when inside brackets.</p>

<p><b>\B</b></p><p>Matches nonword boundaries.</p>

<p><b>\n, \t, etc.</b></p><p>Matches newlines, carriage returns, tabs, etc.</p>

<p><b>\1...\9</b></p><p>Matches nth grouped subexpression.</p>

<p><b>\10</b></p><p>Matches nth grouped subexpression if it matched already. Otherwise refers to the octal representation of a character code.</p>

   print ("searchObj.group(1) : ", searchObj.group(1))
   print ("searchObj.group(2) : ", searchObj.group(2))
else:
   print ("Nothing found!!")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
matchObj.group() :  Cats are smarter than dogs
matchObj.group(1) :  Cats
matchObj.group(2) :  smarter
</pre>
<h2>Matching Versus Searching</h2>
<p>Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: <b>match</b> checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while <b>search</b> checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re

line = "Cats are smarter than dogs";

matchObj = re.match( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I)
if matchObj:
   print ("match --&gt; matchObj.group() : ", matchObj.group())
else:
   print ("No match!!")

searchObj = re.search( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I)
if searchObj:
   print ("search --&gt; searchObj.group() : ", searchObj.group())
else:
   print ("Nothing found!!")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
No match!!
search --&gt; matchObj.group() :  dogs
</pre>
<h2>Search and Replace</h2>
<p>One of the most important <b>re</b> methods that use regular expressions is <b>sub</b>.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
re.sub(pattern, repl, string, max=0)
</pre>
<p>This method replaces all occurrences of the RE <i>pattern</i> in <i>string</i> with <i>repl</i>, substituting all occurrences unless <i>max</i> is provided. This method returns modified string.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re

phone = "2004-959-559 # This is Phone Number"

# Delete Python-style comments
num = re.sub(r'#.*$', "", phone)
print ("Phone Num : ", num)

# Remove anything other than digits
num = re.sub(r'\D', "", phone)    
print ("Phone Num : ", num)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Phone Num :  2004-959-559
Phone Num :  2004959559
</pre>

<title>Python 3 CGI Programming</title>

<h1>Python 3 - CGI Programming</h1>

<p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a set of standards that define how information is exchanged between the web server and a custom script. The CGI specs are currently maintained by the NCSA and NCSA.</p>

<h2>What is CGI?</h2>

<p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a standard for external gateway programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers.</p>

<p>The current version is CGI/1.1 and CGI/1.2 is under progress.</p>

<h2>Web Browsing</h2>

<p>To understand the concept of CGI, let us see what happens when we click a hyper link to browse a particular web page or URL.</p>

<p>Your browser contacts the HTTP web server and demands for the URL, i.e., filename.</p>

<p>Web Server parses the URL and looks for the filename. If it finds that file then sends it back to the browser, otherwise sends an error message indicating that you requested a wrong file.</p>

<p>Web browser takes response from web server and displays either the received file or error message.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever a file in a certain directory is requested that file is not sent back; instead it is executed as a program, and whatever that program outputs is sent back for your browser to display. This function is called the Common Gateway Interface or CGI and the programs are called CGI scripts. These CGI programs can be a Python Script, PERL Script, Shell Script, C or C++ program, etc.</p>

<h2>CGI Architecture Diagram</h2>

<h2>Web Server Support and Configuration</h2>

<p>By default, the Linux server is configured to run only the scripts in the cgi-bin directory in /var/www. If you want to specify any other directory to run your CGI scripts, comment the following lines in the httpd.conf file &minus;</p>

<p>Following line should also be added for apache server to treat .py file as cgi script</p>

<p>Here, we assume that you have Web Server up and running successfully and you are able to run any other CGI program like Perl or Shell, etc.</p>

<h2>First CGI Program</h2>

<p>Here is a simple link, which is linked to a CGI script called <a href="/cgi-bin/hello.py" target="_blank">hello.py</a>. This file is kept in /var/www/cgi-bin directory and it has following content. Before running your CGI program, make sure you have change mode of file using <b>chmod 755 hello.py</b> UNIX command to make file executable.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>First line in the script must be path to Python executable. In Linux it should be #!/usr/bin/python3</p>

<p>Enter following URL in yor browser</p>

<h2>Hello Word! This is my first CGI program</h2>

<p>This hello.py script is a simple Python script, which writes its output on STDOUT file, i.e., screen. There is one important and extra feature available which is first line to be printed <b>Content-type:text/html</b> followed by a blank line. This line is sent back to the browser and it specifies the content type to be displayed on the browser screen.</p>

<p>By now you must have understood basic concept of CGI and you can write many complicated CGI programs using Python. This script can interact with any other external system also to exchange information such as RDBMS.</p>

<h2>HTTP Header</h2>

<p>The line <b>Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b> is part of HTTP header which is sent to the browser to understand the content. All the HTTP header will be in the following form &minus;</p>

<p>There are few other important HTTP headers, which you will use frequently in your CGI Programming.</p>

<h2>CGI Environment Variables</h2>

<p>All the CGI programs have access to the following environment variables. These variables play an important role while writing any CGI program.</p>

<p>Here is small CGI program to list out all the CGI variables. Click this link to see the result <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/get_env.py" target="_blank">Get Environment</a></p>

<h2>GET and POST Methods</h2>

<p>You must have come across many situations when you need to pass some information from your browser to web server and ultimately to your CGI Program. Most frequently, browser uses two methods two pass this information to web server. These methods are GET Method and POST Method.</p>

<h2>Passing Information using GET method</h2>

<p>The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The GET method is the default method to pass information from browser to web server and it produces a long string that appears in your browser's Location:box. Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to pass to the server. The GET method has size limtation: only 1024 characters can be sent in a request string. The GET method sends information using QUERY_STRING header and will be accessible in your CGI Program through QUERY_STRING environment variable.</p>

<p>You can pass information by simply concatenating key and value pairs along with any URL or you can use HTML &lt;FORM&gt; tags to pass information using GET method.</p>

<h2>Simple URL Example:Get Method</h2>

<p>Here is a simple URL, which passes two values to hello_get.py program using GET method.</p>

<p>Below is <b>hello_get.py</b> script to handle input given by web browser. We are going to use <b>cgi</b> module, which makes it very easy to access passed information &minus;</p>

<p>This would generate the following result:</p>

<h2>Hello ZARA ALI</h2>

<h2>Simple FORM Example:GET Method</h2>

<p>Here is the actual output of the above form, you enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>

<h2>Passing Information Using POST Method</h2>

<p>A generally more reliable method  of passing information to a CGI program is the POST method. This packages the information in exactly the same way as GET methods, but instead of sending it as a text string after a ? in the URL it sends it as a separate message. This message comes into the CGI script in the form of the standard input.</p>

<p>Below is same hello_get.py script which handles GET as well as POST method.</p>

<p>Let us take again same example as above which passes two values using HTML FORM and submit button. We use same CGI script hello_get.py to handle this input.</p>

<p>Here is the actual output of the above form. You enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>

<h2>Passing Checkbox Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Checkboxes are used when more than one option is required to be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with two checkboxes &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the above form:</p>

<p>Below is checkbox.cgi script to handle input given by web browser for checkbox button.</p>

<h2>Passing Radio Button Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Radio Buttons are used when only one option is required to be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with two radio buttons &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is radiobutton.py script to handle input given by web browser for radio button:</p>

<h2>Passing Text Area Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>TEXTAREA element is used when multiline text has to be passed to the CGI Program.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with a TEXTAREA box &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is textarea.cgi script to handle input given by web browser &minus;</p>

<h2>Passing Drop Down Box Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Drop Down Box is used when we have many options available but only one or two will be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with one drop down box &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is dropdown.py script to handle input given by web browser.</p>

<h2>Using Cookies in CGI</h2>

<p>HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. For a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information  among different pages. For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. How to maintain user's session information across all the web pages?</p>

<p>In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.</p>

<h2>How It Works?</h2>

<p>Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. The browser may accept the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, the cookie is available for retrieval. Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored.</p>

<p>Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields:</p>

<p><b>Expires:</b> The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p>

<p><b>Domain:</b> The domain name of your site.</p>

<p><b>Path:</b> The path to the directory or web page that sets the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.</p>

<p><b>Secure:</b> If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.</p>

<p><b>Name=Value:</b> Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key and value pairs.</p>

<h2>Setting up Cookies</h2>

<p>It is very easy to send cookies to browser. These cookies are sent along with HTTP Header before to Content-type field. Assuming you want to set UserID and Password as cookies. Setting the cookies is done as follows &minus;</p>

<p>From this example, you must have understood how to set cookies. We use <b>Set-Cookie</b> HTTP header to set cookies.</p>

<p>It is optional to set cookies attributes like Expires, Domain, and Path. It is notable that cookies are set before sending magic line <b>"Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b>.</p>

<h2>Retrieving Cookies</h2>

<p>It is very easy to retrieve all the set cookies. Cookies are stored in CGI environment variable HTTP_COOKIE and they will have following form &minus;</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to retrieve cookies.</p>

<p>This produces the following result for the cookies set by above script &minus;</p>

<h2>File Upload Example</h2>

<p>To upload a file, the HTML form must have the enctype attribute set to <b>multipart/form-data</b>. The input tag with the file type creates a "Browse" button.</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>File: <input type="file" name="filename" /></p>

<p><input type="reset" value="Upload" /></p>

<p>Above example has been disabled intentionally to save people uploading file on our server, but you can try above code with your server.</p>

<p>Here is the script <b>save_file.py</b> to handle file upload &minus;</p>

<p>If you run the above script on Unix/Linux, then you need to take care of replacing  file separator as follows, otherwise on your windows machine above open() statement should work fine.</p>

<h2>How To Raise a "File Download" Dialog Box ?</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is desired that you want to give option where a user can click a link and it will pop up a "File Download" dialogue box to the user instead of displaying actual content. This is very easy and can be achieved through HTTP header. This HTTP header is be different from the header mentioned in previous section.</p>

<p>For example, if you want make a <b>FileName</b> file downloadable from a given link, then its syntax is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin"&gt;
   AllowOverride None
   Options ExecCGI
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin"&gt;
Options All
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
<p>Following line should also be added for apache server to treat .py file as cgi script</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
AddHandler cgi-script .py
</pre>
<p>Here, we assume that you have Web Server up and running successfully and you are able to run any other CGI program like Perl or Shell, etc.</p>
<h2>First CGI Program</h2>
<p>Here is a simple link, which is linked to a CGI script called <a href="/cgi-bin/hello.py" target="_blank">hello.py</a>. This file is kept in /var/www/cgi-bin directory and it has following content. Before running your CGI program, make sure you have change mode of file using <b>chmod 755 hello.py</b> UNIX command to make file executable.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

print ('&lt;/body&gt;')
print ('&lt;/html&gt;')
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b>First line in the script must be path to Python executable. In Linux it should be #!/usr/bin/python3</p>

<h2>Using Cookies in CGI</h2>
<p>HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. For a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information  among different pages. For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. How to maintain user's session information across all the web pages?</p>
<p>In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.</p>
<h2>How It Works?</h2>
<p>Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. The browser may accept the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, the cookie is available for retrieval. Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored.</p>
<p>Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Expires:</b> The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Domain:</b> The domain name of your site.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Path:</b> The path to the directory or web page that sets the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Secure:</b> If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Name=Value:</b> Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key and value pairs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up Cookies</h2>
<p>It is very easy to send cookies to browser. These cookies are sent along with HTTP Header before to Content-type field. Assuming you want to set UserID and Password as cookies. Setting the cookies is done as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

print ("Set-Cookie:UserID=XYZ;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Password=XYZ123;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Expires=Tuesday, 31-Dec-2007 23:12:40 GMT";\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Domain=www.tutorialspoint.com;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Path=/perl;\n")
print ("Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n")
...........Rest of the HTML Content....
</pre>
<p>From this example, you must have understood how to set cookies. We use <b>Set-Cookie</b> HTTP header to set cookies.</p>
<p>It is optional to set cookies attributes like Expires, Domain, and Path. It is notable that cookies are set before sending magic line <b>"Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b>.</p>
<h2>Retrieving Cookies</h2>
<p>It is very easy to retrieve all the set cookies. Cookies are stored in CGI environment variable HTTP_COOKIE and they will have following form &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value3....
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of how to retrieve cookies.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import modules for CGI handling 
from os import environ
import cgi, cgitb

if environ.has_key('HTTP_COOKIE'):
   for cookie in map(strip, split(environ['HTTP_COOKIE'], ';')):
      (key, value ) = split(cookie, '=');
      if key == "UserID":
         user_id = value

      if key == "Password":
         password = value

print ("User ID  = %s" % user_id)
print ("Password = %s" % password)
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result for the cookies set by above script &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
User ID = XYZ
Password = XYZ123
</pre>
<h2>File Upload Example</h2>
<p>To upload a file, the HTML form must have the enctype attribute set to <b>multipart/form-data</b>. The input tag with the file type creates a "Browse" button.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;form enctype="multipart/form-data" 
                     action="save_file.py" method="post"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;File: &lt;input type="file" name="filename" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Upload" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="save_file.py" method="post">
   <p>File: <input type="file" name="filename" /></p>
   <p><input type="reset" value="Upload" /></p>
</form>
<p>Above example has been disabled intentionally to save people uploading file on our server, but you can try above code with your server.</p>
<p>Here is the script <b>save_file.py</b> to handle file upload &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import cgi, os
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

form = cgi.FieldStorage()

# Get filename here.
fileitem = form['filename']

# Test if the file was uploaded
if fileitem.filename:
   # strip leading path from file name to avoid 
   # directory traversal attacks
   fn = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename)
   open('/tmp/' + fn, 'wb').write(fileitem.file.read())

   message = 'The file "' + fn + '" was uploaded successfully'
   
else:
   message = 'No file was uploaded'
   
print ("""\
Content-Type: text/html\n
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
""" % (message,))
</pre>
<p>If you run the above script on Unix/Linux, then you need to take care of replacing  file separator as follows, otherwise on your windows machine above open() statement should work fine.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fn = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename.replace("\\", "/" ))
</pre>

<h2>How To Raise a "File Download" Dialog Box ?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it is desired that you want to give option where a user can click a link and it will pop up a "File Download" dialogue box to the user instead of displaying actual content. This is very easy and can be achieved through HTTP header. This HTTP header is be different from the header mentioned in previous section.</p>
<p>For example, if you want make a <b>FileName</b> file downloadable from a given link, then its syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# HTTP Header
print ("<b>Content-Type:</b>application/octet-stream; name=\"FileName\"\r\n")
print ("<b>Content-Disposition:</b> attachment; filename=\"FileName\"\r\n\n")

# Actual File Content will go hear.
fo = open("foo.txt", "rb")

str = fo.read()
print str

# Close opened file
fo.close()

<title>Python 3 MySQL Database Access</title>

<h1>Python 3 - MySQL Database Access</h1>

<p>The Python standard for database interfaces is the Python DB-API. Most Python database interfaces adhere to this standard.</p>

<p>You can choose the right database for your application. Python Database API supports a wide range of database servers such as &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the list of available Python database interfaces &minus; <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python Database Interfaces and APIs</a>. You must download a separate DB API module for each database you need to access. For example, if you need to access an Oracle database as well as a MySQL database, you must download both the Oracle and the MySQL database modules.</p>

<p>The DB API provides a minimal standard for working with databases using Python structures and syntax wherever possible. This API includes the following:</p>

<p>Python has an in-built support for SQLite. In this section, we would learn all the concepts using MySQL. MySQLdb module, a popular interface with MySQL is not compatible with Python 3. Instead, we shall use <a href="http://www.pymysql.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PyMySQL</a> module.</p>

<h2>What is PyMySQL ?</h2>

<p>PyMySQL is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server from Python. It implements the Python Database API v2.0 and contains a pure-Python MySQL client library. The goal of PyMySQL is to be a drop-in replacement for MySQLdb .</p>

<h2>How do I Install PyMySQL?</h2>

<p>Before proceeding furthur, you make sure you have PyMySQL installed on your machine. Just type the following in your Python script and execute it &minus;</p>

<p>If it produces the following result, then it means MySQLdb module is not installed:</p>

<p>The last stable release is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip &minus;</p>

<p>Alternatively (e.g. if pip is not available), a tarball can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and installed with Setuptools as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Make sure you have root privilege to install the above module.</p>

<h2>Database Connection</h2>

<p>Before connecting to a MySQL database, make sure of the following points &minus;</p>

<p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p>

<p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p>

<p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p>

<p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p>

<p>Python module PyMySQL is installed properly on your machine.</p>

<p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial to understand <a href="/mysql/index.htm">MySQL Basics.</a></p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example of connecting with MySQL database "TESTDB" &minus;</p>

<p>While running this script, it produces the following result.</p>

<p>If a connection is established with the datasource, then a Connection Object is returned and saved into <b>db</b> for further use, otherwise <b>db</b> is set to None. Next, <b>db</b> object is used to create a <b>cursor</b> object, which in turn is used to execute SQL queries. Finally, before coming out, it ensures that the database connection is closed and resources are released.</p>

<h2>Creating Database Table</h2>

<p>Once a database connection is established, we are ready to create tables or records into the database tables using <b>execute</b> method of the created cursor.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a Database table EMPLOYEE &minus;</p>

<h2>INSERT Operation</h2>

<p>The INSERT Operation is required when you want to create your records into a database table.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example, executes SQL <i>INSERT</i> statement to create a record in the EMPLOYEE table &minus;</p>

<p>The above example can be written as follows to create SQL queries dynamically &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following code segment is another form of execution where you can pass parameters directly &minus;</p>

<h2>READ Operation</h2>

<p>READ Operation on any database means to fetch some useful information from the database.</p>

<p>Once the database connection is established, you are ready to make a query into this database. You can use either <b>fetchone()</b> method to fetch a single record or <b>fetchall()</b> method to fetch multiple values from a database table.</p>

<p><b>fetchone()</b> &minus; It fetches the next row of a query result set. A result set is an object that is returned when a cursor object is used to query a table.</p>

<p><b>rowcount</b> &minus; This is a read-only attribute and returns the number of rows that were affected by an execute() method.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following procedure queries all the records from EMPLOYEE table having salary more than 1000 &minus;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Update Operation</h2>

<p>UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>

<p>The following procedure updates all the records having SEX as <b>'M'</b>. Here, we increase the AGE of all the males by one year.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>DELETE Operation</h2>

<p>DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database. Following is the  procedure to delete all the records from EMPLOYEE where AGE is more than 20 &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Performing Transactions</h2>

<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>

<p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p>

<p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p>

<p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p>

<p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p>

<p>The Python DB API 2.0 provides two methods to either <i>commit</i> or <i>rollback</i> a transaction.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You already know how to implement transactions. Here is a similar example &minus;</p>

<h2>COMMIT Operation</h2>

<p>Commit is an operation, which gives a green signal to the database to finalize the changes, and after this operation, no change can be reverted back.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>commit</b> method.</p>

<h2>ROLLBACK Operation</h2>

<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>

<h2>Disconnecting Database</h2>

<p>To disconnect the Database connection, use the close() method.</p>

<p>If the connection to a database is closed by the user with the close() method, any outstanding transactions are rolled back by the DB. However, instead of depending on any of the DB lower level implementation details, your application would be better off calling commit or rollback explicitly.</p>

<h2>Handling Errors</h2>

<p>There are many sources of errors. A few examples are a syntax error in an executed SQL statement, a connection failure, or calling the fetch method for an already canceled or finished statement handle.</p>

<p>The DB API defines a number of errors that must exist in each database module. The following table lists these exceptions.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b></p><p>Used for non-fatal issues. Must subclass StandardError.</p>

<p><b>Error</b></p><p>Base class for errors. Must subclass StandardError.</p>

<p><b>InterfaceError</b></p><p>Used for errors in the database module, not the database itself. Must subclass Error.</p>

<p><b>DatabaseError</b></p><p>Used for errors in the database. Must subclass Error.</p>

<p><b>DataError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors in the data.</p>

<p><b>OperationalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as the loss of a connection to the database. These errors are generally outside of the control of the Python scripter.</p>

<p><b>IntegrityError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError for situations that would damage the relational integrity, such as uniqueness constraints or foreign keys.</p>

<p><b>InternalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors internal to the database module, such as a cursor no longer being active.</p>

<p><b>ProgrammingError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as a bad table name and other things that can safely be blamed on you.</p>

<p><b>NotSupportedError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to trying to call unsupported functionality.</p>

<p>Your Python scripts should handle these errors, but before using any of the above exceptions, make sure your MySQLdb has support for that exception. You can get more information about them by reading the DB API 2.0 specification.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fname = Mac, lname = Mohan, age = 20, sex = M, income = 2000
</pre>
<h2>Update Operation</h2>
<p>UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>
<p>The following procedure updates all the records having SEX as <b>'M'</b>. Here, we increase the AGE of all the males by one year.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to UPDATE required records
sql = "UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET AGE = AGE + 1
                          WHERE SEX = '%c'" % ('M')
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h2>DELETE Operation</h2>
<p>DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database. Following is the  procedure to delete all the records from EMPLOYEE where AGE is more than 20 &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to DELETE required records
sql = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; '%d'" % (20)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h2>Performing Transactions</h2>
<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Python DB API 2.0 provides two methods to either <i>commit</i> or <i>rollback</i> a transaction.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>You already know how to implement transactions. Here is a similar example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Prepare SQL query to DELETE required records
sql = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; '%d'" % (20)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()
</pre>
<h2>COMMIT Operation</h2>
<p>Commit is an operation, which gives a green signal to the database to finalize the changes, and after this operation, no change can be reverted back.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>commit</b> method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.commit()
</pre> 
<h2>ROLLBACK Operation</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.rollback()
</pre>
<h2>Disconnecting Database</h2>
<p>To disconnect the Database connection, use the close() method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.close()
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Networking Programming</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Network Programming</h1>

<p>Python provides two levels of access to the network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.</p>

<p>Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.</p>

<p>This chapter gives you an understanding on the most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.</p>

<h2>What is Sockets?</h2>

<p>Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.</p>

<p>Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The <i>socket</i> library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.</p>

<p>Sockets have their own vocabulary &minus;</p>

<p><b>domain</b></p><p>The family of protocols that is used as the transport mechanism. These values are constants such as AF_INET, PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on.</p>

<p><b>type</b></p>

<p>The type of communications between the two endpoints, typically SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols and SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols.</p>

<p><b>protocol</b></p><p>Typically zero, this may be used to identify a variant of a protocol within a domain and type.</p>

<p><b>hostname</b></p><p>The identifier of a network interface &minus;</p>

<p><b>port</b></p><p>Each server listens for clients calling on one or more ports. A port may be a Fixnum port number, a string containing a port number, or the name of a service.</p>

<h2>The socket Module</h2>

<p>To create a socket, you must use the <i>socket.socket()</i> function available in the socket module, which has the general syntax &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>socket_family</b> &minus; This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.</p>

<p><b>socket_type</b> &minus; This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.</p>

<p><b>protocol</b> &minus; This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.</p>

<p>Once you have <i>socket</i> object, then you can use the required functions to create your client or server program. Following is the list of functions required &minus;</p>

<h2>Server Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.bind()</b></p><p>This method binds address (hostname, port number pair) to socket.</p>

<p><b>s.listen()</b></p><p>This method sets up and start TCP listener.</p>

<p><b>s.accept()</b></p><p>This passively accept TCP client connection, waiting until connection arrives (blocking).</p>

<h2>Client Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.connect()</b></p><p>This method actively initiates TCP server connection.</p>

<h2>General Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.recv()</b></p><p>This method receives TCP message</p>

<p><b>s.send()</b></p><p>This method transmits TCP message</p>

<p><b>s.recvfrom()</b></p><p>This method receives UDP message</p>

<p><b>s.sendto()</b></p><p>This method transmits UDP message</p>

<p><b>s.close()</b></p><p>This method closes socket</p>

<p><b>socket.gethostname()</b></p><p>Returns the hostname.</p>

<h2>A Simple Server</h2>

<p>To write Internet servers, we use the <b>socket</b> function available in socket module to create a socket object. A socket object is then used to call other functions to setup a socket server.</p>

<p>Now call the <b>bind(hostname, port)</b> function to specify a <i>port</i> for your service on the given host.</p>

<p>Next, call the <i>accept</i> method of the returned object. This method waits until a client connects to the port you specified, and then returns a <i>connection</i> object that represents the connection to that client.</p>

<h2>A Simple Client</h2>

<p>Let us write a very simple client program which opens a connection to a given port 12345 and a given host. It is very simple to create a socket client using the Python's <i>socket</i> module function.</p>

<p>The <b>socket.connect(hosname, port )</b> opens a TCP connection to <i>hostname</i> on the <i>port</i>. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When done, remember to close it, as you would close a file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following code is a very simple client that connects to a given host and port, reads any available data from the socket, and then exits &minus;</p>

<p>Now run this server.py in the background and then run the above client.py to see the result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Python Internet Modules</h2>

<p>A list of some important modules in Python Network/Internet programming are given below &minus;</p>

<p>Please check all the libraries  mentioned above to work with FTP, SMTP, POP, and IMAP protocols.</p>

<title>Python 3 Sending Email using SMTP</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Sending Email using SMTP</h1>

<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending an e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. </p>

<p>Python provides <b>smtplib</b> module, which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mails to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.</p>

<p>Here is a simple syntax to create one SMTP object, which can later be used to send an e-mail &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the detail of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>host</b> &minus; This is the host running your SMTP server. You can specifiy IP address of the host or a domain name like tutorialspoint.com. This is an optional argument.</p>

<p><b>port</b> &minus; If you are providing <i>host</i> argument, then you need to specify a port, where SMTP server is listening. Usually this port would be 25.</p>

<p><b>local_hostname</b> &minus; If your SMTP server is running on your local machine, then you can specify just <i>localhost</i> the option.</p>

<p>An SMTP object has an instance method called <b>sendmail</b>, which is typically used to do the work of mailing a message. It takes three parameters &minus;</p>

<p>The <i>sender</i> &minus; A string with the address of the sender.</p>

<p>The <i>receivers</i> &minus; A list of strings, one for each recipient.</p>

<p>The <i>message</i> &minus; A message as a string formatted as specified in the various RFCs.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a simple way to send one e-mail using Python script. Try it once &minus;</p>

<p>Here, you have placed a basic e-mail in message, using a triple quote, taking care to format the headers correctly. An e-mail requires a <b>From</b>, <b>To</b>, and a <b>Subject</b> header, separated from the body of the e-mail with a blank line.</p>

<p>To send the mail you use <i>smtpObj</i> to connect to the SMTP server on the local machine. Then use the <i>sendmail</i> method along with the message, the from address, and the destination address as parameters (even though the from and to addresses are within the e-mail itself, these are not always used to route the mail).</p>

<p>If you are not running an SMTP server on your local machine, you can the use <i>smtplib</i> client to communicate with a remote SMTP server. Unless you are using a webmail service (such as gmail or Yahoo! Mail), your e-mail provider must have provided you with the outgoing mail server details that you can supply them, as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Sending an HTML e-mail using Python</h2>

<p>When you send a text message using Python, then all the content is treated as simple text. Even if you include HTML tags in a text message, it is displayed as simple text and HTML tags will not be formatted according to the HTML syntax. However, Python provides an option to send an HTML message as actual HTML message.</p>

<p>While sending an e-mail message, you can specify a Mime version, content type  and the character set to send an HTML e-mail.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to send the HTML content as an e-mail. Try it once &minus;</p>

<h2>Sending Attachments as an E-mail</h2>

<p>To send an e-mail with mixed content requires setting the <b>Content-type</b> header to <b>multipart/mixed</b>. Then, the text and the attachment sections can be specified within <b>boundaries</b>.</p>

<p>A boundary is started with two hyphens followed by a unique number, which cannot appear in the message part of the e-mail. A final boundary denoting the e-mail's final section must also end with two hyphens.</p>

<p>The attached files should be encoded with the <b>pack("m")</b> function to have base 64 encoding before transmission.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example, which sends  a file <b>/tmp/test.txt</b> as an attachment. Try it once &minus;</p>

<p>Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.</p>

<p>Threads are sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.</p>

<p>A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context is it currently running.</p>

<p>It can be pre-empted (interrupted).</p>

<p>It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.</p>

<p>There are two different kind of threads &minus;</p>

<p>Kernel Threads are a part of the operating system, while the User-space threads are not implemented in the kernel. </p>

<p>There are two modules which support the usage of threads in Python3 &minus;</p>

<p>The thread module has been "deprecated" for quite a long time. Users are encouraged to use the threading module instead. Hence, in Python 3, the module "thread" is not available anymore. However, it has been renamed to "_thread" for backwards compatibilities in Python3. </p>

<h2>Starting a New Thread</h2>

<p>To spawn another thread, you need to call the following method available in the <i>thread</i> module &minus;</p>

<p>This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of <i>args</i>. When the function returns, the thread terminates.</p>

<p>Here, <i>args</i> is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. <i>kwargs </i>is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Program goes in an infinite loop. You will have to press ctrl-c to stop</p>

<p>Although it is very effective for low-level threading, the <i>thread</i> module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.</p>

<h2>The Threading Module</h2>

<p>The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p>The <i>threading</i> module exposes all the methods of the <i>thread</i> module and provides some additional methods &minus;</p>

<p><b>threading.activeCount()</b> &minus; Returns the number of thread objects that are active.</p>

<p><b>threading.currentThread()</b> &minus; Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.</p>

<p><b>threading.enumerate()</b> &minus; Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.</p>

<p>In addition to the methods, the threading module has the <i>Thread</i> class that implements threading. The methods provided by the <i>Thread</i> class are as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>run()</b> &minus; The run() method is the entry point for a thread.</p>

<p><b>start()</b> &minus; The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.</p>

<p><b> join([time])</b> &minus; The join() waits for threads to terminate.</p>

<p><b> isAlive()</b> &minus; The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.</p>

<p><b> getName()</b> &minus; The getName() method returns the name of a thread.</p>

<p><b> setName()</b> &minus; The setName() method sets the name of a thread.</p>

<h2>Creating Thread Using Threading Module</h2>

<p>To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following &minus;</p>

<p>Define a new subclass of the <i>Thread</i> class.</p>

<p>Override the <i>__init__(self [,args])</i> method to add additional arguments.</p>

<p>Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.</p>

<p>Once you have created the new <i>Thread</i> subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the <i>start()</i>, which in turn calls the <i>run()</i> method.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Synchronizing Threads</h2>

<p>The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the <i>Lock()</i> method, which returns the new lock.</p>

<p>The <i>acquire(blocking)</i> method of the new lock object is used to force the threads to run synchronously. The optional <i>blocking</i> parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.</p>

<p>If <i>blocking</i> is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.</p>

<p>The <i>release()</i> method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multithreaded Priority Queue</h2>

<p>The <i>Queue</i> module allows you to create a new queue object that can hold a specific number of items. There are following methods to control the Queue &minus;</p>

<p><b>get()</b> &minus; The get() removes and returns an item from the queue.</p>

<p><b>put()</b> &minus; The put adds item to a queue.</p>

<p><b>qsize() </b> &minus; The qsize() returns the number of items that are currently in the queue.</p>

<p><b>empty()</b> &minus; The empty( ) returns True if queue is empty; otherwise, False.</p>

<p><b>full()</b> &minus; the full() returns True if queue is full; otherwise, False.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<title>Python 3 XML Processing</title>

<h1>Python 3 - XML Processing</h1>

<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of operating system and/or developmental language.</p>

<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard.</p>

<p>XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring an SQL-based backbone.</p>

<h2>XML Parser Architectures and APIs</h2>

<p>The Python standard library provides a minimal but useful set of interfaces to work with XML.</p>

<p>The two most basic and broadly used APIs to XML data are the SAX and DOM interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Simple API for XML (SAX)</b> &minus; Here, you register callbacks for events of interest and then let the parser proceed through the document. This is useful when your documents are large or you have memory limitations, it parses the file as it reads it from the disk and the entire file is never stored in the memory.</p>

<p>SAX obviously cannot process information as fast as DOM, when working with large files. On the other hand, using DOM exclusively can really kill your resources, especially if used on many small files.</p>

<p>SAX is read-only, while DOM allows changes to the XML file. Since these two different APIs literally complement each other, there is no reason why you cannot use them both for large projects.</p>

<p>For all our XML code examples, let us use a simple XML file <i>movies.xml</i> as an input &minus;</p>

<h2>Parsing XML with SAX APIs</h2>

<p>SAX is a standard interface for event-driven XML parsing. Parsing XML with SAX generally requires you to create your own ContentHandler by subclassing xml.sax.ContentHandler.</p>

<p>Your <i>ContentHandler</i> handles the particular tags and attributes of your flavor(s) of XML. A ContentHandler object provides methods to handle various parsing events. Its owning parser calls ContentHandler methods as it parses the XML file.</p>

<p>The methods <i>startDocument</i> and <i>endDocument</i> are called at the start and the end of the XML file. The method <i>characters(text)</i> is passed the character data of the XML file via the parameter text.</p>

<p>The ContentHandler is called at the start and end of each element. If the parser is not in namespace mode, the methods <i>startElement(tag, attributes)</i> and <i>endElement(tag)</i> are called; otherwise, the corresponding methods <i>startElementNS</i> and <i>endElementNS</i> are called. Here, tag is the element tag, and attributes is an Attributes object.</p>

<p>Here are other important methods to understand before proceeding &minus;</p>

<h2>The make_parser Method</h2>

<p>The following method creates a new parser object and returns it. The parser object created will be of the first parser type, the system finds.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>parser_list</b> &minus; The optional argument consisting of a list of parsers to use which must all implement the make_parser method.</p>

<h2>The parse Method</h2>

<p>The following method creates a SAX parser and uses it to parse a document.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>xmlfile</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML file to read from.</p>

<p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p>

<p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p>

<h2>The parseString Method</h2>

<p>There is one more method to create a SAX parser and to parse the specified <b>XML string</b>.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>xmlstring</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML string to read from.</p>

<p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p>

<p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>For a complete detail on SAX API documentation, please refer to the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/xml.sax.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python SAX APIs</a>.</p>

<h2>Parsing XML with DOM APIs</h2>

<p>The Document Object Model ("DOM") is a cross-language API from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying the XML documents.</p>

<p>The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications. SAX only allows you a view of one bit of the document at a time. If you are looking at one SAX element, you have no access to another.</p>

<p>Here is the easiest way to load an XML document quickly and to create a minidom object using the xml.dom module. The minidom object provides a simple parser method that quickly creates a DOM tree from the XML file.</p>

<p>The sample phrase calls the parse( file [,parser] ) function of the minidom object to parse the XML file, designated by file into a DOM tree object.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>For a complete detail on DOM API documentation, please refer to the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python DOM APIs</a>.</p>

<p>For a complete detail on SAX API documentation, please refer to the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/xml.sax.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python SAX APIs</a>.</p> 
<h2>Parsing XML with DOM APIs</h2>
<p>The Document Object Model ("DOM") is a cross-language API from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying the XML documents.</p>
<p>The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications. SAX only allows you a view of one bit of the document at a time. If you are looking at one SAX element, you have no access to another.</p>
<p>Here is the easiest way to load an XML document quickly and to create a minidom object using the xml.dom module. The minidom object provides a simple parser method that quickly creates a DOM tree from the XML file.</p>
<p>The sample phrase calls the parse( file [,parser] ) function of the minidom object to parse the XML file, designated by file into a DOM tree object.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

from xml.dom.minidom import parse
import xml.dom.minidom

# Open XML document using minidom parser
DOMTree = xml.dom.minidom.parse("movies.xml")
collection = DOMTree.documentElement
if collection.hasAttribute("shelf"):
   print ("Root element : %s" % collection.getAttribute("shelf"))

# Get all the movies in the collection
movies = collection.getElementsByTagName("movie")

# Print detail of each movie.
for movie in movies:
   print ("*****Movie*****")
   if movie.hasAttribute("title"):
      print ("Title: %s" % movie.getAttribute("title"))

   type = movie.getElementsByTagName('type')[0]
   print ("Type: %s" % type.childNodes[0].data)
   format = movie.getElementsByTagName('format')[0]
   print ("Format: %s" % format.childNodes[0].data)
   rating = movie.getElementsByTagName('rating')[0]
   print ("Rating: %s" % rating.childNodes[0].data)
   description = movie.getElementsByTagName('description')[0]

<title>Python 3 GUI Programming (Tkinter)</title>

<h1>Python 3  - GUI Programming (Tkinter)</h1>

<p>Python provides various options for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The most important features are listed below.</p>

<p><b>Tkinter</b> &minus; Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. We would look this option in this chapter.</p>

<p><b>wxPython</b> &minus; This is an open-source Python interface for wxWidgets GUI toolkit. You can find a complete tutorial on WxPython <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wxpython/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>PyQt</b> &minus;This is also a Python interface for a popular cross-platform Qt GUI library. TutorialsPoint has a very good tutorial on PyQt <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>JPython</b> &minus; JPython is a Python port for Java, which gives Python scripts seamless access to the Java class libraries on the local machine <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">http://www.jython.org</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other interfaces available, which you can find them on the net.</p>

<h2>Tkinter Programming</h2>

<p>Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.</p>

<p>Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Import the <i>Tkinter</i> module.</p>

<p>Create the GUI application main window.</p>

<p>Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.</p>

<p>Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This would create a following window &minus;</p>

<h2>Tkinter Widgets</h2>

<p>Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets.</p>

<p>There are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter. We present these widgets as well as a brief description in the following table &minus;</p>

<p>The Button widget is used to display the buttons in your application.</p>

<p>The Canvas widget is used to draw shapes, such as lines, ovals, polygons and rectangles, in your application.</p>

<p>The Checkbutton widget is used to display a number of options as checkboxes. The user can select multiple options at a time.</p>

<p>The Entry widget is used to display a single-line text field for accepting values from a user.</p>

<p>The Frame widget is used as a container widget to organize other widgets.</p>

<p>The Label widget is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. It can also contain images.</p>

<p>The Listbox widget is used to provide a list of options to a user.</p>

<p>The Menubutton widget is used to display menus in your application.</p>

<p>The Menu widget is used to provide various commands to a user. These commands are contained inside Menubutton.</p>

<p>The Message widget is used to display multiline text fields for accepting values from a user.</p>

<p>The Radiobutton widget is used to display a number of options as radio buttons. The user can select only one option at a time.</p>

<p>The Scale widget is used to provide a slider widget.</p>

<p>The Scrollbar widget is used to add scrolling capability to various widgets, such as list boxes.</p>

<p>The Text widget is used to display text in multiple lines.</p>

<p>The Toplevel widget is used to provide a separate window container.</p>

<p>The Spinbox widget is a variant of the standard Tkinter Entry widget, which can be used to select from a fixed number of values.</p>

<p>A PanedWindow is a container widget that may contain any number of panes, arranged horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>A labelframe is a simple container widget. Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer or container for complex window layouts.</p>

<p>This module is used to display message boxes in your applications.</p>

<h2>Standard attributes</h2>

<p>Let us look at how some of their common attributes, such as sizes, colors and fonts are specified.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_dimensions.htm">Dimensions</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_colors.htm">Colors</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_fonts.htm">Fonts</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_anchors.htm">Anchors</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_relief.htm">Relief styles</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_bitmaps.htm">Bitmaps</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_cursors.htm">Cursors</a></p>

<h2>Geometry Management</h2>

<p>All Tkinter widgets have access to the specific geometry management methods, which have the purpose of organizing widgets throughout the parent widget area. Tkinter exposes the following geometry manager classes: pack, grid, and place.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_pack.htm">The pack() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_grid.htm">The grid() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets in a table-like structure in the parent widget.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_place.htm">The place() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget.</p>

<title>Python 3 Extension Programming with C</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Extension Programming with C</h1>

<p>Any code that you write using any compiled language like C, C&plus;&plus;, or Java can be integrated or imported into another Python script. This code is considered as an "extension."</p>

<p>A Python extension module is nothing more than a normal C library. On Unix machines, these libraries usually end in <b>.so</b> (for shared object). On Windows machines, you typically see <b>.dll</b> (for dynamically linked library).</p>

<h2>Pre-Requisites for Writing Extensions</h2>

<p>To start writing your extension, you are going to need the Python header files.</p>

<p>On Unix machines, this usually requires installing a developer-specific package such as <a href="https://packages.debian.org/etch-m68k/python2.5-dev" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">python2.5-dev</a>.</p>

<p>Windows users get these headers as part of the package when they use the binary Python installer.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is assumed that you have a good knowledge of C or C&plus;&plus; to write any Python Extension using C programming.</p>

<h2>First look at a Python Extension</h2>

<p>For your first look at a Python extension module, you need to group your code into four part &minus;</p>

<p>The header file <i>Python.h</i>.</p>

<p>The C functions you want to expose as the interface from your module.</p>

<p>A table mapping the names of your functions as Python developers see them as C functions inside the extension module.</p>

<p>An initialization function.</p>

<h2>The Header File Python.h</h2>

<p>You need to include <i>Python.h</i> header file in your C source file, which gives you the access to the internal Python API used to hook your module into the interpreter.</p>

<p>Make sure to include Python.h before any other headers you might need. You need to follow the includes with the functions you want to call from Python.</p>

<h2>The C Functions</h2>

<p>The signatures of the C implementation of your functions always takes one of the following three forms &minus;</p>

<p>Each one of the preceding declarations returns a Python object. There is no such thing as a <i>void </i> function in Python as there is in C. If you do not want your functions to return a value, return the C equivalent of Python's <b>None</b> value. The Python headers define a macro, Py_RETURN_NONE, that does this for us.</p>

<p>The names of your C functions can be whatever you like as they are never seen outside of the extension module. They are defined as <i>static</i> function.</p>

<p>Your C functions usually are named by combining the Python module and function names together, as shown here &minus;</p>

<p>This is a Python function called <i>func</i> inside the module <i>module</i>. You will be putting pointers to your C functions into the method table for the module that usually comes next in your source code.</p>

<h2>The Method Mapping Table</h2>

<p>This method table is a simple array of PyMethodDef structures. That structure looks something like this &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the members of this structure &minus;</p>

<p><b>ml_name</b> &minus; This is the name of the function as the Python interpreter presents when it is used in Python programs.</p>

<p><b>ml_meth</b> &minus; This is the address of a function that has any one of the signatures described in the previous section.</p>

<p><b>ml_flags</b> &minus; This tells the interpreter which of the three signatures ml_meth is using.</p>

<p>This flag usually has a value of METH_VARARGS.</p>

<p>This flag can be bitwise OR'ed with METH_KEYWORDS if you want to allow keyword arguments into your function.</p>

<p>This can also have a value of METH_NOARGS that indicates you do not want to accept any arguments.</p>

<p><b>ml_doc</b> &minus; This is the docstring for the function, which could be NULL if you do not feel like writing one.</p>

<p>This table needs to be terminated with a sentinel that consists of NULL and 0 values for the appropriate members.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the above-defined function, we have the following method mapping table &minus;</p>

<h2>The Initialization Function</h2>

<p>The last part of your extension module is the initialization function. This function is called by the Python interpreter when the module is loaded. It is required that the function be named <b>init<i>Module</i></b>, where <i>Module</i> is the name of the module.</p>

<p>The initialization function needs to be exported from the library you will be building. The Python headers define PyMODINIT_FUNC to include the appropriate incantations for that to happen for the particular environment in which we are compiling. All you have to do is use it when defining the function.</p>

<p>Your C initialization function generally has the following overall structure &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of <b>Py_InitModule3</b> function &minus;</p>

<p><b>func</b> &minus; This is the function to be exported.</p>

<p><b>module_methods</b> &minus; This is the mapping table name defined above.</p>

<p><b>docstring</b> &minus; This is the comment you want to give in your extension.</p>

<p>Putting all this together, it looks like the following &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A simple example that makes use of all the above concepts &minus;</p>

<p>Here the <i>Py_BuildValue</i> function is used to build a Python value. Save above code in hello.c file. We would see how to compile and install this module to be called from Python script.</p>

<h2>Building and Installing Extensions:</h2>

<p>The <i>distutils</i> package makes it very easy to distribute Python modules, both pure Python and extension modules, in a standard way. Modules are distributed in the source form, built and installed via a setup script usually called <i>setup.py</i> as.</p>

<p>For the above module, you need to prepare the following setup.py script &minus;</p>

<p>Now, use the following command, which would perform all needed compilation and linking steps, with the right compiler and linker commands and flags, and copies the resulting dynamic library into an appropriate directory &minus;</p>

<p>On Unix-based systems, you will most likely need to run this command as root in order to have permissions to write to the site-packages directory. This usually is not a problem on Windows.</p>

<h2>Importing Extensions</h2>

<p>Once you install your extensions, you would be able to import and call that extension in your Python script as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Passing Function Parameters</h2>

<p>As you will most likely want to define functions that accept arguments, you can use one of the other signatures for your C functions. For example, the following function, that accepts some number of parameters, would be defined like this &minus;</p>

<p>The method table containing an entry for the new function would look like this &minus;</p>

<p>You can use the API <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> function to extract the arguments from the one PyObject pointer passed into your C function.</p>

<p>The first argument to PyArg_ParseTuple is the args argument. This is the object you will be <i>parsing</i>. The second argument is a format string describing the arguments as you expect them to appear. Each argument is represented by one or more characters in the format string as follows.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Compiling the new version of your module and importing it enables you to invoke the new function with any number of arguments of any type &minus;</p>

<p>You can probably come up with even more variations.</p>

<h2>The PyArg_ParseTuple Function</h2>

<p>Here is the standard signature for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>This function returns 0 for errors, and a value not equal to 0 for success. Tuple is the PyObject* that was the C function's second argument. Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes mandatory and optional arguments.</p>

<p>Here is a list of format codes for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>

<h2>Returning Values</h2>

<p><i>Py_BuildValue</i> takes in a format string much like <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> does. Instead of passing in the addresses of the values you are building, you pass in the actual values. Here is an example showing how to implement an add function &minus;</p>

<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>

<p>You can return two values from your function as follows. This would be captured using a list in Python.</p>

<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>Py_BuildValue</i> Function:</h2>

<p>Here is the standard signature for <b>Py_BuildValue</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes the Python object to build. The following arguments of <i>Py_BuildValue</i> are C values from which the result is built. The <i>PyObject*</i> result is a new reference.</p>

<p>The following table lists the commonly used code strings, of which zero or more are joined into a string format.</p>

<p>Code {...} builds dictionaries from an even number of C values, alternately keys and values. For example, Py_BuildValue("{issi}",23,"zig","zag",42) returns a dictionary like Python's {23:'zig','zag':42}.</p>

Hello, Python extensions!!
</pre>
<h2>Passing Function Parameters</h2>
<p>As you will most likely want to define functions that accept arguments, you can use one of the other signatures for your C functions. For example, the following function, that accepts some number of parameters, would be defined like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   /* Parse args and do something interesting here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
</pre>
<p>The method table containing an entry for the new function would look like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyMethodDef module_methods[] = {
   { "func", (PyCFunction)module_func, METH_NOARGS, NULL },
   { "func", module_func, METH_VARARGS, NULL },
   { NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};
</pre>
<p>You can use the API <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> function to extract the arguments from the one PyObject pointer passed into your C function.</p>
<p>The first argument to PyArg_ParseTuple is the args argument. This is the object you will be <i>parsing</i>. The second argument is a format string describing the arguments as you expect them to appear. Each argument is represented by one or more characters in the format string as follows.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int i;
   double d;
   char *s;

   if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ids", &amp;i, &amp;d, &amp;s)) {
      return NULL;
   }
   
   /* Do something interesting here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Compiling the new version of your module and importing it enables you to invoke the new function with any number of arguments of any type &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
module.func(1, s = "three", d = 2.0)
module.func(i = 1, d = 2.0, s = "three")
module.func(s = "three", d = 2.0, i = 1)
</pre>
<p>You can probably come up with even more variations.</p>
<h2>The PyArg_ParseTuple Function</h2>
<p>Here is the standard signature for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int PyArg_ParseTuple(PyObject* tuple,char* format,...)
</pre>
<p>This function returns 0 for errors, and a value not equal to 0 for success. Tuple is the PyObject* that was the C function's second argument. Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes mandatory and optional arguments.</p>
<p>Here is a list of format codes for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>
<h2>Returning Values</h2>
<p><i>Py_BuildValue</i> takes in a format string much like <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> does. Instead of passing in the addresses of the values you are building, you pass in the actual values. Here is an example showing how to implement an add function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *foo_add(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int a;
   int b;

   if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ii", &amp;a, &amp;b)) {
      return NULL;
   }
   return Py_BuildValue("i", a + b);
}
</pre>
<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def add(a, b):
   return (a + b)
</pre>
<p>You can return two values from your function as follows. This would be captured using a list in Python.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *foo_add_subtract(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int a;
   int b;

   if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ii", &amp;a, &amp;b)) {
      return NULL;
   }
   return Py_BuildValue("ii", a + b, a - b);
}

<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def add_subtract(a, b):
   return (a + b, a - b)
</pre>
<h2>The <i>Py_BuildValue</i> Function:</h2>

<title>Python 3 Quick Guide</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Quick Guide</h1>

<h1>What is New in Python 3?</h1>

<h2>The __future__ module</h2>

<p>For example, if we want Python 3.x's integer division behavior in Python 2, add the following import statement.</p>

<h2>The print Function</h2>

<p>Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the <b>print</b> function is used. Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.</p>

<p>The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end =' '" appends space instead of newline.</p>

<h2>Reading Input from Keyboard</h2>

<p>Python 2 has two versions of input functions, <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b>. The input() function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the data is treated as number.</p>

<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always treated as string.</p>

<h2>Integer Division</h2>

<p>In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will result in 1.5</p>

<p>Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.</p>

<h2>Unicode Representation</h2>

<p>Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. </p>

<p>Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 byte classes: byte and byte arrays.</p>

<h2>xrange() Function Removed</h2>

<p>In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate the items in the range when needed, saving memory.</p>

<p>In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later.</p>

<h2>raise exceprion</h2>

<p>Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.</p>

<h2>Arguments in Exceptions</h2>

<p>In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.</p>

<h2>next() Function and .next() Method</h2>

<p>In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 as a generator method is discontinued and raises <b>AttributeError</b>.</p>

<h2>2to3 Utility</h2>

<p>Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid Python 3.x code.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Overview</h1>

<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

<p><b>Python is Interpreted</b> &minus; Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p>

<p><b>Python is Interactive</b> &minus; You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p>

<p><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> &minus; Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p>

<p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> &minus; Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>

<h2>History of Python</h2>

<p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p>

<p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>

<p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p>

<p>Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of Python 3.</p>

<h2>Python Features</h2>

<p>Python's features include &minus;</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-learn</b> &minus; Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows a student to pick up the language quickly.</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-read</b> &minus; Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</p>

<p><b>Easy-to-maintain</b> &minus; Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</p>

<p><b>A broad standard library</b> &minus; Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</p>

<p><b>Interactive Mode</b> &minus; Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</p>

<p><b>Portable</b> &minus; Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</p>

<p><b>Extendable</b> &minus; You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</p>

<p><b>Databases</b> &minus; Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</p>

<p><b>GUI Programming</b> &minus; Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</p>

<p><b>Scalable</b> &minus; Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</p>

<p>Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features. A, few are listed below &minus;</p>

<p>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</p>

<p>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</p>

<p>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</p>

<p>It supports automatic garbage collection.</p>

<p>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Environment Setup</h1>

<h3>Try it Option Online</h3>

<p>We have set up the Python Programming environment online, so that you can compile and execute all the available examples online. It will give you the confidence in what you are reading and will enable you to verify the programs with different options. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

<p>Try the following example using our online compiler available at <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/codingground.htm">CodingGround</a></p>

<p>For most of the examples given in this tutorial, you will find a <b>Try it</b> option on our website code sections, at the top right corner that will take you to the online compiler. Just use it and enjoy your learning.</p>

<p>Python 3 is available for Windows, Mac OS and most of the flavors of Linux operating system. Even though Python 2 is available for many other OSs, Python 3 support either has not been made available for them or has been dropped.</p>

<h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>

<p>Open a terminal window and type "python" to find out if it is already installed and which version is installed.</p>

<h2>Getting Python</h2>

<h3>Windows platform</h3>

<p>Binaries of latest version of Python 3 (Python 3.5.1) are available on <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">this download page</a></p>

<p>The following different installation options are available.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to install Python 3.5.1, minimum OS requirements are Windows 7 with SP1. For versions 3.0 to 3.4.x Windows XP is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Linux platform</h3>

<p>Different flavors of Linux use different package managers for installation of new packages.</p>

<p>On Ubuntu Linux, Python 3 is installed using the following command from the terminal.</p>

<p>Installation from source</p>

<p>Download Gzipped source tarball from Python's download URL &minus; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz</a></p>

<h3>Mac OS</h3>

<p>Download Mac OS installers from this URL &minus; <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/</a></p>

<p>Double click this package file and follow the wizard instructions to install.</p>

<p>The most up-to-date and current source code, binaries, documentation, news, etc., is available on the official website of Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>Python Official Website</b> &minus; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

<p>You can download Python documentation from the following site. The documentation is available in HTML, PDF and PostScript formats.</p>

<p><b>Python Documentation Website</b> &minus; <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.python.org/doc/" target="_blank">www.python.org/doc/</a></p>

<h2>Setting up PATH</h2>

<p>Programs and other executable files can be in many directories. Hence, the operating systems provide a search path that lists the directories that it searches for executables.</p>

<p>The important features are &minus;</p>

<p>The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintained by the operating system. This variable contains information available to the command shell and other programs.</p>

<p>The path variable is named as <b>PATH</b> in Unix or <b>Path</b> in Windows (Unix is case-sensitive; Windows is not).</p>

<p>In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Python interpreter from any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path.</p>

<h2>Setting Path at Unix/Linux</h2>

<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Unix &minus;</p>

<p><b>In the csh shell</b> &minus; type setenv PATH "$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>In the bash shell (Linux)</b> &minus; type export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/bin/python3.4 and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>In the sh or ksh shell</b> &minus; type PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>Note &minus; </b> /usr/local/bin/python3 is the path of the Python directory.</p>

<h2>Setting Path at Windows</h2>

<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Windows &minus;</p>

<p><b>At the command prompt</b> &minus; type path %path%;C:\Python and press Enter.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; C:\Python is the path of the Python directory </p>

<h2>Python Environment Variables</h2>

<p>Here are important environment variables, which are recognized by Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>PYTHONPATH</b></p><p>It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONSTARTUP</b></p><p>It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONCASEOK</b></p><p>It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.</p>

<p><b>PYTHONHOME</b></p><p>It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.</p>

<h2>Running Python</h2>

<p>There are three different ways to start Python &minus;</p>

<h3>Interactive Interpreter</h3>

<p>You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.</p>

<p>Enter <b>python</b> the command line.</p>

<p>Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter.</p>

<p>Here is the list of all the available command line options &minus;</p>

<p><b>-d</b></p><p>provide debug output</p>

<p><b>-O</b></p><p>generate optimized bytecode (resulting in .pyo files)</p>

<p><b>-S</b></p><p>do not run import site to look for Python paths on startup</p>

<p><b>-v</b></p><p>verbose output (detailed trace on import statements)</p>

<p><b>-X</b></p><p>disable class-based built-in exceptions (just use strings); obsolete starting with version 1.6</p>

<p><b>-c cmd</b></p><p>run Python script sent in as cmd string</p>

<p><b>file</b></p><p>run Python script from given file</p>

<h3>Script from the Command-line</h3>

<p>A Python script can be executed at the command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as shown in the following example.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Be sure the file permission mode allows execution.</p>

<h3>Integrated Development Environment</h3>

<p>You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.</p>

<p><b>Unix</b> &minus; IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.</p>

<p><b>Windows</b> &minus; <b>PythonWin</b> is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.</p>

<p><b>Macintosh</b> &minus; The Macintosh version of Python  along with the IDLE IDE is available from the main website, downloadable as either MacBinary or BinHex'd files.</p>

<p>If you are not able to set up the environment properly, then you can take the help of your system admin. Make sure the Python environment is properly set up and working perfectly fine.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; All the examples given in subsequent chapters are executed with Python 3.4.1 version available on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<p>We have already set up Python Programming environment online, so that you can execute all the available examples online while you are learning theory. Feel free to modify any example and execute it online.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>

<h2>First Python Program</h2>

<p>Let us execute the programs in different modes of programming.</p>

<h3>Interactive Mode Programming</h3>

<p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt &minus;</p>

<p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press Enter &minus;</p>

<p>If you are running the older version of Python (Python 2.x), use of parenthesis as <b>inprint</b> function is optional. This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Script Mode Programming</h3>

<p>Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>

<p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have the extension <b>.py</b>. Type the following source code in a test.py file &minus;</p>

<p>We assume that you have the Python interpreter set in <b>PATH</b> variable. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>On Linux</b></p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>On Windows</b></p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Let us try another way to execute a Python script in Linux. Here is the modified test.py file &minus;</p>

<p>We assume that you have Python interpreter available in the /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Python Identifiers</h2>

<p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>

<p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in Python.</p>

<p>Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</p>

<p>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.</p>

<p>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.</p>

<p>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.</p>

<h2>Reserved Words</h2>

<p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>

<h2>Lines and Indentation</h2>

<p>Python does not use braces({}) to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>

<p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example &minus;</p>

<p>However, the following block generates an error &minus;</p>

<p>Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with the same number of spaces would form a block. The following example has various statement blocks &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Do not try to understand the logic at this point of time. Just make sure you understood the various blocks even if they are without braces.</p>

<h2>Multi-Line Statements</h2>

<p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python, however, allows the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example &minus;</p>

<p>The statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Quotation in Python</h2>

<p>Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>

<p>The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal &minus;</p>

<h2>Comments in Python</h2>

<p>A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal is the beginning of a comment. All characters after the #, up to the end of the physical line, are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can type a comment on the same line after a statement or expression &minus;</p>

<p>Python does not have multiple-line commenting feature. You have to comment each line individually as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Using Blank Lines</h2>

<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and Python totally ignores it.</p>

<p>In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to terminate a multiline statement.</p>

<h2>Waiting for the User</h2>

<p>The following line of the program displays the prompt and, the statement saying “Press the enter key to exit”, and then waits for the user to take action &minus;</p>

<p>Here, "\n\n" is used to create two new lines before displaying the actual line. Once the user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console window open until the user is done with an application.</p>

<h2>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h2>

<p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on a single line given that no statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Statement Groups as Suites</h2>

<p>Groups of individual statements, which make a single code block are called <b>suites</b> in Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.</p>

<p>Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : ) and are followed by one or more lines which make up the suite. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Command Line Arguments</h2>

<p>Many programs can be run to provide you with some basic information about how they should be run. Python enables you to do this with -<b>h</b> &minus;</p>

<p>You can also program your script in such a way that it should accept various options. <a href="/python3/python_command_line_arguments.htm">Command Line Arguments</a> is an advanced topic. Let us understand it.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Variable Types</h1>

<p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.</p>

<p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>

<h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>

<p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>

<p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and  "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multiple Assignment</h2>

<p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>

<h2>Standard Data Types</h2>

<p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>

<p>Python has five standard data types &minus;</p>

<p>Numbers</p>

<p>String</p>

<p>List</p>

<p>Tuple</p>

<p>Dictionary</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_numbers.htm">Python Numbers</a></h2>

<p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>

<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>

<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement.</p>

<p>For example &minus;</p>

<p>Python supports three different numerical types &minus;</p>

<p>int (signed integers)</p>

<p>float (floating point real values)</p>

<p>complex (complex numbers)</p>

<p>All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type as long.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of numbers &minus;</p>

<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x &plus; yj, where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_strings.htm">Python Strings</a></h2>

<p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows either pair of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.</p>

<p>The plus (&plus;) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_lists.htm">Python Lists</a></h2>

<p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One of the differences between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>

<p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (&plus;) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_tuples.htm">Python Tuples</a></h2>

<p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.</p>

<p>The main difference between lists and tuples are &minus; Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as <b>read-only</b> lists. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The following code is invalid with tuple, because we attempted to update a tuple, which is not allowed. Similar case is possible with lists &minus;</p>

<h2><a href="/python3/python_dictionary.htm">Python Dictionary</a></h2>

<p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]). For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Dictionaries have no concept of order among the elements. It is incorrect to say that the elements are "out of order"; they are simply unordered.</p>

<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you may need to perform conversions between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type-names as a function.</p>

<p>There are several built-in functions to perform conversion from one data type to another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value.</p>

<p><b>int(x [,base])</b></p>

<p>Converts x to an integer. The base specifies the base if x is a string.</p>

<p><b>float(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts x to a floating-point number.</p>

<p><b>complex(real [,imag])</b></p>

<p>Creates a complex number.</p>

<p><b>str(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts object x to a string representation.</p>

<p><b>repr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts object x to an expression string.</p>

<p><b>eval(str)</b></p>

<p>Evaluates a string and returns an object.</p>

<p><b>tuple(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a tuple.</p>

<p><b>list(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a list.</p>

<p><b>set(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a set.</p>

<p><b>dict(d)</b></p>

<p>Creates a dictionary. d must be a sequence of (key,value) tuples.</p>

<p><b>frozenset(s)</b></p>

<p>Converts s to a frozen set.</p>

<p><b>chr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a character.</p>

<p><b>unichr(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a Unicode character.</p>

<p><b>ord(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts a single character to its integer value.</p>

<p><b>hex(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to a hexadecimal string.</p>

<p><b>oct(x)</b></p>

<p>Converts an integer to an octal string.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Basic Operators</h1>

<p>Operators are the constructs, which can manipulate the value of operands. Consider the expression 4 &plus; 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called the operands and &plus; is called the operator.</p>

<h2>Types of Operator</h2>

<p>Python language supports the following types of operators &minus;</p>

<p>Arithmetic Operators</p>

<p>Comparison (Relational) Operators</p>

<p>Assignment Operators</p>

<p>Logical Operators</p>

<p><a href="/python3/arithmetic_operators_example.htm" alt="Python Arithmetic Operators Example">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Python Comparison Operators</h2>

<p>These operators compare the values on either side of them and decide the relation among them. They are also called Relational operators.</p>

<p>Assume variable <b>a</b> holds the value 10 and variable <b>b</b> holds the value 20, then &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/assignment_operators_example.htm" alt="Python Assignment Operators Example">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Python Bitwise Operators</h2>

<p>Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit-by-bit operation. Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; Now in binary format they will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>a = 0011 1100</p>

<p>b = 0000 1101</p>

<p>-----------------</p>

<p>a&amp;b = 0000 1100</p>

<p>a|b = 0011 1101</p>

<p>a^b = 0011 0001</p>

<p>~a = 1100 0011</p>

<p>Python's built-in function bin() can be used to obtain binary representation of an integer number. </p>

<p>The following Bitwise operators are supported by Python language &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/bitwise_operators_example.htm" alt="Python Bitwise Operators Example">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Python Logical Operators</h2>

<p>The following logical operators are supported by Python language. Assume variable <b>a</b> holds True and variable <b>b</b> holds False then &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/logical_operators_example.htm" alt="Python Logical Operators Example">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Python Membership Operators</h2>

<p>Python’s membership operators test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, or tuples. There are two membership operators as explained below &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/membership_operators_example.htm" alt="Python Membership Operators Example">Show Example</a></p>

<p><b>not or and</b></p><p>Logical operators</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision-making is the anticipation of conditions occurring during the execution of a program and specified actions taken according to the conditions.</p>

<p>Decision structures evaluate multiple expressions, which produce TRUE or FALSE as the outcome. You need to determine which action to take and which statements to execute if the outcome is TRUE or FALSE otherwise.</p>

<p>Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages &minus;</p>

<p>Python programming language assumes any <b>non-zero</b> and <b>non-null</b> values as TRUE, and any <b>zero</b> or <b>null values</b> as FALSE value.</p>

<p>Python programming language provides the following types of decision-making statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if statement</b> consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>An <b>if statement</b> can be followed by an optional <b>else statement</b>, which executes when the boolean expression is FALSE.</p>

<p>You can use one <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement inside another <b>if</b> or <b>else if</b> statement(s).</p>

<p>Let us go through each decision-making statement quickly.</p>

<h2>Single Statement Suites</h2>

<p>If the suite of an <b>if</b> clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as the header statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of a <b>one-line if</b> clause &minus;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Loops</h1>

<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially &minus; The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>

<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement &minus;</p>

<p>Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

<p>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</p>

<p>You can use one or more loop inside any another while, or for loop.</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>

<p>The Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When the execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>

<p>Python supports the following control statements.</p>

<p>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>

<p>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</p>

<p>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p>

<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly.</p>

<h2>Iterator and Generator</h2>

<p><b>Iterator</b> is an object which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a collection, regardless of its specific implementation. In Python, an iterator object implements two methods, <b>iter()</b> and <b>next()</b>.</p>

<p>String, List or Tuple objects can be used to create an Iterator.</p>

<p>A <b>generator</b> is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.</p>

<p>When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution of the function. When the next() method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. The yield keeps track i.e. remembers the last execution and the second next() call continues from previous value.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example defines a generator, which generates an iterator for all the Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Numbers</h1>

<p>Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types. This means, changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.</p>

<p>Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>

<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>

<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Python supports  different numerical types &minus;</p>

<p><b>complex (complex numbers)</b> &minus; are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.</p>

<p>It is possible to represent an integer in hexa-decimal or octal form</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Here are some examples of numbers.</p>

<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by a &plus; bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part of the complex number.</p>

<h2>Number Type Conversion</h2>

<p>Python converts numbers internally in an expression containing mixed types to a common type for evaluation. Sometimes, you need to coerce a number explicitly from one type to another to satisfy the requirements of an operator or function parameter.</p>

<p>Type <b>int(x)</b> to convert x to a plain integer.</p>

<p>Type <b>long(x)</b> to convert x to a long integer.</p>

<p>Type <b>float(x)</b> to convert x to a floating-point number.</p>

<p>Type <b>complex(x)</b> to convert x to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part zero.</p>

<p>Type <b>complex(x, y)</b> to convert x and y to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y. x and y are numeric expressions</p>

<h2>Mathematical Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following functions that perform mathematical calculations.</p>

<p>The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.</p>

<p>The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x.</p>

<p>cmp(x, y)</p>

<p>-1 if x &lt; y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x &gt; y. <b>Deprecated</b> in Python 3. Instead use <b> return (x&gt;y)-(x&lt;y)</b>.</p>

<p>The exponential of x: e<sup>x</sup></p>

<p>The absolute value of x.</p>

<p>The floor of x: the largest integer not greater than x.</p>

<p>The natural logarithm of x, for x &gt; 0.</p>

<p>The base-10 logarithm of x for x &gt; 0.</p>

<p>The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity</p>

<p>The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity.</p>

<p>The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple. Both parts have the same sign as x. The integer part is returned as a float.</p>

<p>The value of x**y.</p>

<p><b>x</b> rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0.</p>

<p>The square root of x for x &gt; 0.</p>

<h2>Random Number Functions</h2>

<p>Random numbers are used for games, simulations, testing, security, and privacy applications. Python includes the following functions that are commonly used.</p>

<p>A random item from a list, tuple, or string.</p>

<p>A randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step).</p>

<p>A random float r, such that 0 is less than or equal to r and r is less than 1</p>

<p>Sets the integer starting value used in generating random numbers. Call this function before calling any other random module function. Returns None.</p>

<p>Randomizes the items of a list in place. Returns None.</p>

<p>A random float r, such that x is less than or equal to r and r is less than y.</p>

<h2>Trigonometric Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following functions that perform trigonometric calculations.</p>

<p>Return the arc cosine of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return the arc sine of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.</p>

<p>Return atan(y / x), in radians.</p>

<p>Return the cosine of x radians.</p>

<p>Return the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x*x + y*y).</p>

<p>Return the sine of x radians.</p>

<p>Return the tangent of x radians.</p>

<p>Converts angle x from radians to degrees.</p>

<p>Converts angle x from degrees to radians.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Constants</h2>

<p>The module also defines two mathematical constants &minus;</p>

<p><b>pi</b></p>

<p>The mathematical constant pi.</p>

<p><b>e</b></p>

<p>The mathematical constant e.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Strings</h1>

<p>Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable. For example &minus;</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Strings</h2>

<p>Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.</p>

<p>To access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain your substring. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Strings</h2>

<p>You can "update" an existing string by (re)assigning a variable to another string. The new value can be related to its previous value or to a completely different string altogether. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Escape Characters</h2>

<p>Following table is a list of escape or non-printable characters that can be represented with backslash notation.</p>

<p>An escape character gets interpreted; in a single quoted as well as double quoted strings.</p>

<h2>String Special Operators</h2>

<p>Assume string variable <b>a</b> holds 'Hello' and variable <b>b</b> holds 'Python', then &minus;</p>

<h2>String Formatting Operator</h2>

<p>One of Python's coolest features is the string format operator %. This operator is unique to strings and makes up for the pack of having functions from C's printf() family. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the list of complete set of symbols which can be used along with % &minus;</p>

<p><b>%c</b></p><p>character</p>

<p><b>%s</b></p><p>string conversion via str() prior to formatting</p>

<p><b>%i</b></p><p>signed decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%d</b></p><p>signed decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%u</b></p><p>unsigned decimal integer</p>

<p><b>%o</b></p><p>octal integer</p>

<p><b>%x</b></p><p>hexadecimal integer (lowercase letters)</p>

<p><b>%X</b></p>

<p><b>%e</b></p><p>exponential notation (with lowercase 'e')</p>

<p><b>%E</b></p><p>exponential notation (with UPPERcase 'E')</p>

<p><b>%f</b></p><p>floating point real number</p>

<p><b>%g</b></p><p>the shorter of %f and %e</p>

<p><b>%G</b></p><p>the shorter of %f and %E</p>

<p>Other supported symbols and functionality are listed in the following table &minus;</p>

<p><b>*</b></p>

<p>argument specifies width or precision</p>

<p><b>-</b></p>

<p>left justification</p>

<p><b>&plus;</b></p>

<p>display the sign</p>

<p><b>&lt;sp&gt;</b></p>

<p>leave a blank space before a positive number</p>

<p><b>#</b></p>

<p>add the octal leading zero ( '0' ) or hexadecimal leading '0x' or '0X', depending on whether 'x' or 'X' were used.</p>

<p><b>0</b></p>

<p>pad from left with zeros (instead of spaces)</p>

<p><b>%</b></p>

<p>'%%' leaves you with a single literal '%'</p>

<p><b>(var)</b></p>

<p>mapping variable (dictionary arguments)</p>

<p><b>m.n.</b></p>

<p>m is the minimum total width and n is the number of digits to display after the decimal point (if appl.)</p>

<h2>Triple Quotes</h2>

<p>Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines, including verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.</p>

<p>The syntax for triple quotes consists of three consecutive <b>single or double</b> quotes.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result. Note how every single special character has been converted to its printed form, right down to the last NEWLINE at the end of the string between the "up." and closing triple quotes. Also note that NEWLINEs occur either with an explicit carriage return at the end of a line or its escape code (\n) &minus;</p>

<p>Raw strings do not treat the backslash as a special character at all. Every character you put into a raw string stays the way you wrote it &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Now let's make use of raw string. We would put expression in <b>r'expression'</b> as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Unicode String</h2>

<p>In Python 3, all strings are represented in Unicode.In Python 2 are stored internally as 8-bit ASCII, hence it is required to attach 'u' to make it Unicode. It is no longer necessary now.</p>

<h3>Built-in String Methods</h3>

<p>Python includes the following built-in methods to manipulate strings &minus;</p>

<p>Performs both lstrip() and rstrip() on string</p>

<p>Inverts case for all letters in string.</p>

<p>Returns "titlecased" version of string, that is, all words begin with uppercase and the rest are lowercase.</p>

<p>Translates string according to translation table str(256 chars), removing those in the del string.</p>

<p>Converts lowercase letters in string to uppercase.</p>

<p>Returns original string leftpadded with zeros to a total of width characters; intended for numbers, zfill() retains any sign given (less one zero).</p>

<p>Returns true if a unicode string contains only decimal characters and false otherwise.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Lists</h1>

<p>The most basic data structure in Python is the <b>sequence</b>. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.</p>

<p>Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.</p>

<p>There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.</p>

<h2>Python Lists</h2>

<p>The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that the items in a list need not be of the same type.</p>

<p>Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be sliced, concatenated and so on.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Lists</h2>

<p>To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Lists</h2>

<p>You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append() method. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete List Elements</h2>

<p>To remove a list element, you can use either the <b>del</b> statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting. You can use the remove() method if you do not know exactly which items to delete. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>

<h2>Basic List Operations</h2>

<p>Lists respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.</p>

<p>In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior chapter.</p>

<h2>Indexing, Slicing and Matrixes</h2>

<p>Since lists are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for lists as they do for strings.</p>

<p>Assuming the following input &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Built-in List Functions and Methods</h2>

<p>Python includes the following list functions &minus;</p>

<p>No longer available in Python 3.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the list.</p>

<p>Returns item from the list with max value.</p>

<p>Returns item from the list with min value.</p>

<p>Converts a tuple into list.</p>

<p>Python includes the following list methods &minus;</p>

<p>Appends object obj to list</p>

<p>Returns count of how many times obj occurs in list</p>

<p>Appends the contents of seq to list</p>

<p>Returns the lowest index in list that obj appears</p>

<p>Inserts object obj into list at offset index</p>

<p>Removes and returns last object or obj from list</p>

<p>Removes object obj from list</p>

<p>Reverses objects of list in place</p>

<p>Sorts objects of list, use compare func if given</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Tuples</h1>

<p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The main difference between the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists. Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.</p>

<p>Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally, you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example &minus;</p>

<p>The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing &minus;</p>

<p>To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value &minus;</p>

<p>Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Tuples</h2>

<p>To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain the value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Tuples</h2>

<p>Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example demonstrates &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete Tuple Elements</h2>

<p>Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.</p>

<p>To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; An exception is raised. This is because after <b>del tup</b>, tuple does not exist any more.</p>

<h2>Basic Tuples Operations</h2>

<p>Tuples respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.</p>

<p>In fact, tuples respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the previous chapter.</p>

<h2>Indexing, Slicing, and Matrixes</h2>

<p>Since tuples are sequences, indexing and slicing work the same way for tuples as they do for strings, assuming the following input &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<h2>No Enclosing Delimiters</h2>

<p>No enclosing Delimiters is any set of multiple objects, comma-separated, written without identifying symbols, i.e., brackets for lists, parentheses for tuples, etc., default to tuples, as indicated in these short examples.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Built-in Tuple Functions</h2>

<p>Python includes the following tuple functions &minus;</p>

<p>Compares elements of both tuples.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the tuple.</p>

<p>Returns item from the tuple with max value.</p>

<p>Returns item from the tuple with min value.</p>

<p>Converts a list into tuple.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Dictionary</h1>

<p>Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.</p>

<p>Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>

<h2>Accessing Values in Dictionary</h2>

<p>To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>If we attempt to access a data item with a key, which is not a part of the dictionary, we get an error as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Updating Dictionary</h2>

<p>You can update a dictionary by adding a new entry or a key-value pair, modifying an existing entry, or deleting an existing entry as shown in a simple example given below.</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Delete Dictionary Elements</h2>

<p>You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.</p>

<p>To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the <b>del</b> statement. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result.</p>

<p>An exception is raised because after <b>del dict</b>, the dictionary does not exist anymore.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The del() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>

<h2>Properties of Dictionary Keys</h2>

<p>Dictionary values have no restrictions. They can be any arbitrary Python object, either standard objects or user-defined objects. However, same is not true for the keys.</p>

<p>There are two important points to remember about dictionary keys &minus;</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> More than one entry per key is not allowed. This means no duplicate key is allowed. When duplicate keys are encountered during assignment, the last assignment wins. For example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Keys must be immutable. This means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Built-in Dictionary Functions and Methods</h2>

<p>Python includes the following dictionary functions &minus;</p>

<p>No longer available in Python 3.</p>

<p>Gives the total length of the dictionary. This would be equal to the number of items in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Produces a printable string representation of a dictionary</p>

<p>Returns the type of the passed variable. If passed variable is dictionary, then it would return a dictionary type.</p>

<p>Python includes the following dictionary methods &minus;</p>

<p>Removes all elements of dictionary <i>dict</i></p>

<p>Returns a shallow copy of dictionary <i>dict</i></p>

<p> Create a new dictionary with keys from seq and values <i>set</i> to <i>value</i>.</p>

<p>For <i>key</i> key, returns value or default if key not in dictionary</p>

<p>Removed, use the <i>in</i> operation instead.</p>

<p>Returns a list of <i>dict</i>'s (key, value) tuple pairs</p>

<p>Returns list of dictionary dict's keys</p>

<p>Similar to get(), but will set dict[key] = default if <i>key</i> is not already in dict</p>

<p>Adds dictionary <i>dict2</i>'s key-values pairs to <i>dict</i></p>

<p>Returns list of dictionary <i>dict</i>'s values</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Date &amp; Time</h1>

<p>A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.</p>

<h2>What is Tick?</h2>

<p>Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds. Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>

<p>There is a popular <b>time</b> module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. The function <b>time.time()</b> returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This would produce a result something as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be represented in this form. Dates in the far future also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.</p>

<h2>What is TimeTuple?</h2>

<p>Many of the Python's time functions handle time as a tuple of 9 numbers, as shown below &minus;</p>

<p>For Example &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce a result as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The above tuple is equivalent to <b>struct_time</b> structure. This structure has following attributes &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting current time</h2>

<p>To translate a time instant from seconds since the epoch floating-point value into a timetuple, pass the floating-point value to a function (e.g., localtime) that returns a time-tuple with all valid nine items.</p>

<p>This would produce the following result, which could be formatted in any other presentable form &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting formatted time</h2>

<p>You can format any time as per your requirement, but a simple method to get time in a readable format is <b>asctime()</b> &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Getting calendar for a month</h2>

<p>The calendar module gives a wide range of methods to play with yearly and monthly calendars. Here, we print a calendar for a given month ( Jan 2008 ) &minus;</p>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The time Module</h2>

<p>There is a popular <b>time</b> module available in Python, which provides functions for working with times and for converting between representations. Here is the list of all available methods.</p>

<p>The offset of the local DST timezone, in seconds west of UTC, if one is defined. This is negative if the local DST timezone is east of UTC (as in Western Europe, including the UK). Use this if the daylight is nonzero.</p>

<p>Accepts a time-tuple and returns a readable 24-character string such as 'Tue Dec 11 18:07:14 2008'.</p>

<p>Returns the current CPU time as a floating-point number of seconds. To measure computational costs of different approaches, the value of time.clock is more useful than that of time.time().</p>

<p>Like asctime(localtime(secs)) and without arguments is like asctime( )</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed in seconds since the epoch and returns a time-tuple t with the UTC time. Note &minus; t.tm_isdst is always 0</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed in seconds since the epoch and returns a time-tuple t with the local time (t.tm_isdst is 0 or 1, depending on whether DST applies to instant secs by local rules).</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed as a time-tuple in local time and returns a floating-point value with the instant expressed in seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>Suspends the calling thread for secs seconds.</p>

<p>Accepts an instant expressed as a time-tuple in local time and returns a string representing the instant as specified by string fmt.</p>

<p>Parses str according to format string fmt and returns the instant in time-tuple format.</p>

<p>Returns the current time instant, a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p>Resets the time conversion rules used by the library routines. The environment variable TZ specifies how this is done.</p>

<p>There are two important attributes available with time module. They are &minus;</p>

<p><b>time.timezone</b></p>

<p>Attribute time.timezone is the offset in seconds of the local time zone (without DST) from UTC (&gt;0 in the Americas; &lt;=0 in most of Europe, Asia, Africa).</p>

<p><b>time.tzname</b></p>

<p>Attribute time.tzname is a pair of locale-dependent strings, which are the names of the local time zone without and with DST, respectively.</p>

<h2>The calendar Module</h2>

<p>The calendar module supplies calendar-related functions, including functions to print a text calendar for a given month or year.</p>

<p> By default, calendar takes Monday as the first day of the week and Sunday as the last one. To change this, call the <b>calendar.setfirstweekday()</b> function.</p>

<p>Here is a list of functions available with the <b>calendar</b> module &minus;</p>

<p><b>calendar.calendar(year,w = 2,l = 1,c = 6)</b></p>

<p>Returns a multiline string with a calendar for year year formatted into three columns separated by c spaces. w is the width in characters of each date; each line has length 21*w&plus;18&plus;2*c. l is the number of lines for each week.</p>

<p><b>calendar.firstweekday( )</b></p>

<p>Returns the current setting for the weekday that starts each week. By default, when calendar is first imported, this is 0, meaning Monday.</p>

<p><b>calendar.isleap(year)</b></p>

<p>Returns True if year is a leap year; otherwise, False.</p>

<p><b>calendar.leapdays(y1,y2)</b></p>

<p>Returns the total number of leap days in the years within range(y1,y2).</p>

<p><b>calendar.month(year,month,w = 2,l = 1)</b></p>

<p>Returns a multiline string with a calendar for month month of year year, one line per week plus two header lines. w is the width in characters of each date; each line has length 7*w&plus;6. l is the number of lines for each week.</p>

<p><b>calendar.monthcalendar(year,month)</b></p>

<p>Returns a list of lists of ints. Each sublist denotes a week. Days outside month month of year year are set to 0; days within the month are set to their day-of-month, 1 and up.</p>

<p><b>calendar.monthrange(year,month)</b></p>

<p>Returns two integers. The first one is the code of the weekday for the first day of the month month in year year; the second one is the number of days in the month. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday); month numbers are 1 to 12.</p>

<p><b>calendar.prcal(year,w = 2,l = 1,c = 6)</b></p>

<p>Like print calendar.calendar(year,w,l,c).</p>

<p><b>calendar.prmonth(year,month,w = 2,l = 1)</b></p>

<p>Like print calendar.month(year,month,w,l).</p>

<p><b>calendar.setfirstweekday(weekday)</b></p>

<p>Sets the first day of each week to weekday code weekday. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday).</p>

<p><b>calendar.timegm(tupletime)</b></p>

<p>The inverse of time.gmtime: accepts a time instant in time-tuple form and returns the same instant as a floating-point number of seconds since the epoch.</p>

<p><b>calendar.weekday(year,month,day)</b></p>

<p>Returns the weekday code for the given date. Weekday codes are 0 (Monday) to 6 (Sunday); month numbers are 1 (January) to 12 (December).</p>

<h2>Other Modules and Functions</h2>

<p>If you are interested, then here you would find a list of other important modules and functions to play with date &amp; time in Python &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Functions</h1>

<p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>

<p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called <i>user-defined functions.</i></p>

<h3>Defining a Function</h3>

<p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>

<p>Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</p>

<p>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</p>

<p>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or <i>docstring</i>.</p>

<p>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</p>

<p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>

<h2>Calling a Function</h2>

<p>Defining a function gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>

<p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is an example to call the <b>printme()</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Pass by Reference vs Value</h2>

<p>All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. For example &minus;</p>

<p>Here, we are maintaining reference of the passed object and appending values in the same object. Therefore, this would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.</p>

<p>The parameter <b>mylist</b> is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect mylist. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Function Arguments</h2>

<p>You can call a function by using the following types of formal arguments &minus;</p>

<p>Required arguments</p>

<p>Keyword arguments</p>

<p>Default arguments</p>

<p>Variable-length arguments</p>

<h2>Required Arguments</h2>

<p>Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order. Here, the number of arguments in the function call should match exactly with the function definition.</p>

<p>To call the function <b>printme()</b>, you definitely need to pass one argument, otherwise it gives a syntax error as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Keyword Arguments</h2>

<p>Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.</p>

<p>This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the <b>printme()</b> function in the following ways &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>The following example gives a clearer picture. Note that the order of parameters does not matter.</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Default Arguments</h2>

<p>A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. The following example gives an idea on default arguments, it prints default age if it is not passed &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Variable-length Arguments</h2>

<p>You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function. These arguments are called <i>variable-length</i> arguments and are not named in the function definition, unlike required and default arguments.</p>

<p>Syntax for a function with non-keyword variable arguments is given below &minus;</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) is placed before the variable name that holds the values of all nonkeyword variable arguments. This tuple remains empty if no additional arguments are specified during the function call. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The Anonymous Functions</h2>

<p>These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the <b>def</b> keyword. You can use the <b>lambda</b> keyword to create small anonymous functions.</p>

<p>Lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.</p>

<p>An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression.</p>

<p>Lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.</p>

<p>Although it appears that lambdas are a one-line version of a function, they are not equivalent to inline statements in C or C++, whose purpose is to stack allocation by passing function, during invocation for performance reasons.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax of <b>lambda</b> functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Following is an example to show how <b>lambda</b> form of function works &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The return Statement</h2>

<p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>

<p>All the examples given below are not returning any value. You can return a value from a function as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Scope of Variables</h2>

<p>All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program. This depends on where you have declared a variable.</p>

<p>The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. There are two basic scopes of variables in Python &minus;</p>

<p>Global variables</p>

<p>Local variables</p>

<h2>Global vs. Local variables</h2>

<p>Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.</p>

<p>This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Modules</h1>

<p>A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.</p>

<p>Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The Python code for a module named aname normally resides in a file namedaname.py. Here is an example of a simple module, support.py &minus;</p>

<h2>The import Statement</h2>

<p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file. The <b>import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>

<p>When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. For example, to import the module hello.py, you need to put the following command at the top of the script &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening repeatedly, if multiple imports occur.</p>

<h2>The from...import Statement</h2>

<p>Python's <b>from</b> statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The <b>from...import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>

<p>For example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following statement &minus;</p>

<h2>The from...import * Statement</h2>

<p>It is also possible to import all the names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement &minus;</p>

<p>This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.</p>

<h2>Executing Modules as Scripts</h2>

<p>Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. The code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to "__main__".</p>

<p>Add this code at the end of your module &minus;</p>

<p>When you run the above code, the following output will be displayed.</p>

<h2>Locating Modules</h2>

<p>When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences &minus;</p>

<p>The current directory.</p>

<p>If the module is not found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p>If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python3/.</p>

<p>The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the <b>sys.path</b> variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.</p>

<h2>The PYTHONPATH Variable</h2>

<p>The PYTHONPATH is an environment variable, consisting of a list of directories. The syntax of PYTHONPATH is the same as that of the shell variable PATH.</p>

<p>Here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a Windows system &minus;</p>

<p>And here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a UNIX system &minus;</p>

<h2>Namespaces and Scoping</h2>

<p>Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. A <i>namespace</i> is a dictionary of variable names (keys) and their corresponding objects (values).</p>

<p>A Python statement can access variables in a <i>local namespace</i> and in the <i>global namespace</i>. If a local and a global variable have the same name, the local variable shadows the global variable.</p>

<p>Each function has its own local namespace. Class methods follow the same scoping rule as ordinary functions.</p>

<p>Python makes educated guesses on whether variables are local or global. It assumes that any variable assigned a value in a function is local.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to assign a value to a global variable within a function, you must first use the global statement.</p>

<p>For example, we define a variable <i>Money</i> in the global namespace. Within the function Money, we assign Money a value,  therefore Python assumes Money as a local variable.</p>

<p>However, we accessed the value of the local variable <i>Money</i> before setting it, so an UnboundLocalError is the result. Uncommenting the global statement fixes the problem.</p>

<h2>The dir( ) Function</h2>

<p>The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module.</p>

<p>The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Here, the special string variable __name__ is the module's name, and  __file__ is the filename from which the module was loaded.</p>

<h2>The globals() and locals() Functions</h2>

<p>The <b>globals()</b> and <b>locals()</b> functions can be used to return the names in the global and local namespaces depending on the location from where they are called.</p>

<p>If <b>locals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed locally from that function.</p>

<p>If <b>globals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed globally from that function.</p>

<p>The return type of both these functions is dictionary. Therefore, names can be extracted using the <b>keys()</b> function.</p>

<h2>The reload() Function</h2>

<p>When a module is imported into a script, the code in the top-level portion of a module is executed only once.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to reexecute the top-level code in a module, you can use the <i>reload()</i> function. The reload() function imports a previously imported module again. The syntax of the reload() function is this &minus;</p>

<p>Here, module_name is the name of the module you want to reload and not the string containing the module name. For example, to reload hello module, do the following &minus;</p>

<h2>Packages in Python</h2>

<p>A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.</p>

<p>Consider a file <i>Pots.py</i>  available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of source code &minus;</p>

<p>Similar, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above. They are &minus;</p>

<p><i>Phone/Isdn.py</i> file having function Isdn()</p>

<p><i>Phone/G3.py</i> file having function G3()</p>

<p>Now, create one more file __init__.py in the <i>Phone</i> directory &minus;</p>

<p>To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows &minus;</p>

<p>After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In the above example, we have taken example of a single function in each file,  but you can keep multiple functions in your files. You can also define different Python classes in those files and then you can create your packages out of those classes.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Files I/O</h1>

<p>This chapter covers all the basic I/O functions available in Python 3. For more functions, please refer to the standard Python documentation.</p>

<h2>Printing to the Screen</h2>

<p>The simplest way to produce output is using the <i>print</i> statement where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and writes the result to standard output as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result on your standard screen &minus;</p>

<h2>Reading Keyboard Input</h2>

<p>Python 2 has two built-in functions to read data from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b></p>

<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Moreover, input() functions read data from keyboard as string, irrespective of whether it is enclosed with quotes ('' or "" ) or not.</p>

<h2>The input Function</h2>

<p>The <b>input([prompt])</b> function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes that the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.</p>

<h2>Opening and Closing Files</h2>

<p>Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.</p>

<p>Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a <b>file</b> object.</p>

<h2>The open Function</h2>

<p>Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a <b>file</b> object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here are parameter details &minus;</p>

<p><b>file_name</b> &minus; The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.</p>

<p><b>access_mode</b> &minus; The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is an optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).</p>

<p><b>buffering</b> &minus; If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering  takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).</p>

<p>Here is a list of the different modes of opening a file &minus;</p>

<p><b>r</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.</p>

<p><b>rb</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.</p>

<p><b>r&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p><b>rb&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.</p>

<p><b>w</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>wb</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>w&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>wb&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>a</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>ab</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.</p>

<p><b>a&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<p><b>ab&plus;</b></p>

<p>Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.</p>

<h2>The file Object Attributes</h2>

<p>Once a file is opened and you have one <i>file</i> object, you can get various information related to that file.</p>

<p>Here is a list of all the attributes related to a file object &minus;</p>

<p><b>file.closed</b></p>

<p>Returns true if file is closed, false otherwise.</p>

<p><b>file.mode</b></p>

<p>Returns access mode with which file was opened.</p>

<p><b>file.name</b></p>

<p>Returns name of the file.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; softspace attribute is not supported in Python 3.x</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The close() Method</h2>

<p>The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.</p>

<p>Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Reading and Writing Files</h2>

<p>The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would see how to use <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> methods to read and write files.</p>

<h2>The write() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>write()</b> method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data and not just text.</p>

<p>The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and finally it would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have the following content &minus;</p>

<h2>The read() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>read()</b> method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data. apart from text data.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if <i>count</i> is missing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>File Positions</h2>

<p>The <i>tell()</i> method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.</p>

<p>The <i>seek(offset[, from])</i> method changes the current file position. The <b>offset</b> argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The <b>from</b> argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.</p>

<p>If <i>from</i> is set to 0, the beginning of the file is used as the reference position. If it is set to 1, the current position is used as the reference position. If it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Renaming and Deleting Files</h2>

<p>Python <b>os</b> module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as renaming and deleting files.</p>

<p>To use this module, you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.</p>

<h2>The rename() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>rename()</b> method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to rename an existing file <i>test1.txt</i> &minus;</p>

<h2>The remove() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <b>remove()</b> method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be deleted as the argument.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to delete an existing file <i>test2.txt</i> &minus;</p>

<h2>Directories in Python</h2>

<p>All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these too. The <b>os</b> module has several methods that help you create, remove, and change directories.</p>

<h2>The mkdir() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <b>mkdir()</b> method of the <b>os</b> module to create directories in the current directory. You need to supply an argument to this method, which contains the name of the directory to be created.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to create a directory <i>test</i> in the current directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The chdir() Method</h2>

<p>You can use the <i>chdir()</i> method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current directory.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to go into "/home/newdir" directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The getcwd() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>getcwd()</b> method displays the current working directory.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to give current directory &minus;</p>

<h2>The rmdir() Method</h2>

<p>The <b>rmdir()</b> method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method.</p>

<p>Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to remove the "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current directory.</p>

<h2>File and Directory Related Methods</h2>

<p>There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility methods to handle and manipulate files &amp; directories on Windows and Unix operating systems. They are as follows &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python3/file_methods.htm">File Object Methods</a></p>

<p>The <b>file</b> object provides functions to manipulate files.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/os_file_methods.htm">OS Object Methods</a></p>

<p>This provides methods to process files as well as directories.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/os_path_methods.htm">OS.Path Object Methods.</a>: This provides important functions to get information about a file or directory. </p>

<h1>Python 3 - Exceptions Handling</h1>

<p>Python provides two very important features to handle any unexpected error in your Python programs and to add debugging capabilities in them &minus;</p>

<p><b>Exception Handling</b> &minus; This would be covered in this tutorial. Here is a list standard Exceptions available in Python &minus; <a href="/python3/python_exceptions.htm#standard_exceptions">Standard Exceptions</a>.</p>

<p><b>Assertions</b> &minus; This would be covered in <a href="/python3/python_exceptions.htm#assertion_python">Assertions in Python 3</a> tutorial.</p>

<h2><a name="standard_exceptions">Standard Exceptions</a></h2>

<p>Here is a list of Standard Exceptions available in Python. &minus;</p>

<p>Raised when a generated error does not fall into any category.</p>

<p><b>NotImplementedError</b></p>

<p>Raised when an abstract method that needs to be implemented in an inherited class is not actually implemented.</p>

<h2><a name="assertion_python">Assertions in Python</a></h2>

<p>An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.</p>

<p>The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a <b>raise-if</b> statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.</p>

<p>Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.</p>

<p>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.</p>

<h3>The assert Statement</h3>

<p>When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises an <i>AssertionError</i> exception.</p>

<p>The syntax for assert is &minus;</p>

<p>If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception, using the try-except statement. If they are not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit. Since 0° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative temperature &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>What is Exception?</h2>

<p>An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.</p>

<p>When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.</p>

<h2>Handling an exception</h2>

<p>If you have some <i>suspicious</i> code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a <b>try:</b> block. After the try: block, include an <b>except:</b> statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here is simple syntax of <i>try....except...else</i> blocks &minus;</p>

<p>Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax &minus;</p>

<p>A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.</p>

<p>You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.</p>

<p>After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.</p>

<p>The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This example opens a file, writes content in the, file and comes out gracefully because there is no problem at all &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This example tries to open a file where you do not have the write permission, so it raises an exception &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The except Clause with No Exceptions</h2>

<p>You can also use the except statement with no exceptions defined as follows &minus;</p>

<p>This kind of a <b>try-except</b> statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.</p>

<h2>The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions</h2>

<p>You can also use the same <i>except</i> statement to handle multiple exceptions as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>The try-finally Clause</h2>

<p>You can use a <b>finally:</b> block along with a <b>try:</b> block. The <b>finally:</b> block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You cannot use <i>else</i> clause as well along with a finally clause.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Same example can be written more cleanly as follows &minus;</p>

<p>When an exception is thrown in the <i>try</i> block, the execution immediately passes to the <i>finally</i> block. After all the statements in the <i>finally</i> block are executed, the exception is raised again and is handled in the <i>except</i> statements if present in the next higher layer of the <i>try-except</i> statement.</p>

<h2>Argument of an Exception</h2>

<p>An exception can have an <i>argument</i>, which is a value that gives additional information about the problem. The contents  of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable in the except clause as follows &minus;</p>

<p>If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.</p>

<p>This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error string, the error number, and an error location.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example for a single exception &minus;</p>

<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Raising an Exception</h2>

<p>You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the <b>raise</b> statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Here, <i>Exception</i> is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and <i>argument</i> is a value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.</p>

<p>The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above exception, we must write the except clause as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception &minus;</p>

<p>This will produce the following result</p>

<h2>User-Defined Exceptions</h2>

<p>Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.</p>

<p>Here is an example related to <i>RuntimeError</i>. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from <i>RuntimeError</i>. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.</p>

<p>In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class <i>Networkerror</i>.</p>

<p>So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Object Oriented</h1>

<p>Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.</p>

<p>If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.</p>

<p>However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you &minus;</p>

<h2>Overview of OOP Terminology</h2>

<p><b>Class</b> &minus; A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </p>

<p><b>Class variable</b> &minus; A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are. </p>

<p><b>Data member</b> &minus; A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. </p>

<p><b>Function overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.</p>

<p><b>Instance variable</b> &minus; A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class. </p>

<p><b>Inheritance</b> &minus; The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it. </p>

<p><b>Instance</b> &minus;  An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</p>

<p><b>Instantiation</b> &minus; The creation of an instance of a class. </p>

<p><b>Method </b> &minus; A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</p>

<p><b>Object</b> &minus; A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. </p>

<p><b>Operator overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.</p>

<h2>Creating Classes</h2>

<p>The <i>class</i> statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword <i>class</i> followed by a colon as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via <i><b>ClassName.__doc__</b></i>.</p>

<p>The <i><b>class_suite</b></i> consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example of a simple Python class &minus;</p>

<p>The variable <i>empCount</i> is a class variable whose value is shared among all the instances of a in this class. This can be accessed as <i>Employee.empCount</i> from inside the class or outside the class.</p>

<p>The first method <i>__init__()</i> is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.</p>

<p>You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is <i>self</i>. Python adds the <i>self</i> argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods.</p>

<h2>Creating Instance Objects</h2>

<p>To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its <i>__init__</i> method accepts.</p>

<h2>Accessing Attributes</h2>

<p>You access the object's attributes using the dot operator with object. Class variable would be accessed using class name as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Now, putting all  the concepts together &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>You can add, remove, or modify attributes of classes and objects at any time &minus;</p>

<p>Instead of using the normal statements to access attributes, you can use the following functions &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>getattr(obj, name[, default])</b> &minus; to access the attribute of object.</p>

<p>The <b>hasattr(obj,name)</b> &minus; to check if an attribute exists or not.</p>

<p>The <b>setattr(obj,name,value)</b> &minus; to set an attribute. If attribute does not exist, then it would be created.</p>

<p>The <b>delattr(obj, name)</b> &minus; to delete an attribute.</p>

<h2>Built-In Class Attributes</h2>

<p>Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute &minus;</p>

<p><b>__dict__</b> &minus; Dictionary containing the class's namespace.</p>

<p><b>__doc__</b> &minus; Class documentation string or none, if undefined. </p>

<p><b>__name__</b> &minus; Class name. </p>

<p><b>__module__</b> &minus; Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode. </p>

<p><b>__bases__</b> &minus; A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.</p>

<p>For the above class let us try to access all these attributes &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Destroying Objects (Garbage Collection)</h2>

<p>Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is termed as Garbage Collection.</p>

<p>Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.</p>

<p>An object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object's reference count decreases when it is deleted with <i>del</i>, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python collects it automatically.</p>

<p>You normally will not notice when the garbage collector destroys an orphaned instance and reclaims its space. However, a class can implement the special method <i>__del__()</i>, called a destructor, that is invoked when the instance is about to be destroyed. This method might be used to clean up any non-memory resources used by an instance.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This __del__() destructor prints the class name of an instance that is about to be destroyed &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Ideally, you should define your classes in a separate file, then you should import them in your main program file using <i>import</i> statement.</p>

<p>In the above example, assuming definition of a Point class is contained in <i>point.py</i> and there is no other executable code in it.</p>

<h2>Class Inheritance</h2>

<p>Instead of starting from a scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a pre-existing class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.</p>

<p>The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base classes to inherit from is given after the class name &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>In a similar way, you can drive a class from multiple parent classes as follows &minus;</p>

<p>You can use issubclass() or isinstance() functions to check a relationships of two classes and instances.</p>

<p>The <b>issubclass(sub, sup)</b> boolean function returns True, if the given subclass <b>sub</b> is indeed a subclass of the superclass <b>sup</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>isinstance(obj, Class)</b> boolean function returns True, if <i>obj</i> is an instance of class <i>Class</i> or is an instance of a subclass of Class</p>

<h2>Overriding Methods</h2>

<p>You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding parent's methods is that you may want special or different functionality in your subclass.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Base Overloading Methods</h2>

<p>The following table lists some generic functionality that you can override in your own classes &minus;</p>

<p><b>__init__ ( self [,args...] )</b></p>

<p>Constructor (with any optional arguments)</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>obj = className(args)</i></p>

<p><b>__del__( self )</b></p>

<p>Destructor, deletes an object</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>del obj</i></p>

<p><b>__repr__( self )</b></p>

<p>Evaluatable string representation</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>repr(obj)</i></p>

<p><b>__str__( self )</b></p>

<p>Printable string representation</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>str(obj)</i></p>

<p><b>__cmp__ ( self, x )</b></p>

<p>Object comparison</p>

<p>Sample Call : <i>cmp(obj, x)</i></p>

<h2>Overloading Operators</h2>

<p>Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors. What happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.</p>

<p>You could, however, define the <i>__add__</i> method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Data Hiding</h2>

<p>An object's attributes may or may not be visible outside the class definition. You need to name attributes with a double underscore prefix, and those attributes then will not be directly visible to outsiders.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. You can access such attributes as <i>object._className__attrName</i>. If you would replace your last line as following, then it works for you &minus;</p>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Regular Expressions</h1>

<p>A <i>regular expression</i> is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.</p>

<p>The module <b>re</b> provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The <b>re</b> module raises the exception <b>re.error</b> if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.</p>

<p>We would cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular expressions. Nevertheless, a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have special meaning when they are used in regular expression. To avoid any confusion while dealing with regular expressions, we would use Raw Strings as <b>r'expression'</b>.</p>

<h3>Basic patterns that match single chars</h3>

<p><b>a, X, 9, &lt;</b></p>

<p>ordinary characters just match themselves exactly.</p>

<p><b>. (a period)</b></p>

<p>matches any single character except newline '\n'</p>

<p><b>\w</b></p>

<p>matches a "word" character: a letter or digit or underbar [a-zA-Z0-9_].</p>

<p><b>\W</b></p>

<p>matches any non-word character.</p>

<p><b>\b</b></p>

<p>boundary between word and non-word</p>

<p><b>\s</b></p>

<p>matches a single whitespace character -- space, newline, return, tab</p>

<p><b>\S</b></p>

<p>matches any non-whitespace character.</p>

<p><b>\t, \n, \r</b></p>

<p>tab, newline, return</p>

<p><b>\d</b></p>

<p>decimal digit [0-9]</p>

<p><b>&#94;</b></p>

<p>matches start of the string</p>

<p><b>&dollar;</b></p>

<p>match the end of the string</p>

<p><b>\</b></p>

<p>inhibit the "specialness" of a character.</p>

<h3>Compilation flags</h3>

<p>Compilation flags let you modify some aspects of how regular expressions work. Flags are available in the re module under two names, a long name such as <b>IGNORECASE</b> and a short, one-letter form such as I.</p>

<p><b>ASCII, A</b></p>

<p>Makes several escapes like \w, \b, \s and \d match only on ASCII characters with the respective   property.</p>

<p><b>DOTALL, S</b></p>

<p>Make, match any character, including newlines</p>

<p><b>IGNORECASE, I</b></p>

<p>Do case-insensitive matches</p>

<p><b>LOCALE, L</b></p>

<p>Do a locale-aware match</p>

<p><b>MULTILINE, M</b></p>

<p>Multi-line matching, affecting &#94; and &dollar;</p>

<p><b>VERBOSE, X (for ‘extended’)</b></p>

<p>Enable verbose REs, which can be organized more cleanly and understandably</p>

<h2>The match Function</h2>

<p>This function attempts to match RE <i>pattern</i> to <i>string</i> with optional <i>flags</i>.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax for this function &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>pattern</b></p>

<p>This is the regular expression to be matched.</p>

<p><b>string</b></p>

<p>This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern at the beginning of string.</p>

<p><b>flags</b></p>

<p>You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The <i>re.match</i> function returns a <b>match</b> object on success, <b>None</b> on failure. We use<i>group(num)</i> or <i>groups()</i> function of <b>match</b> object to get matched expression.</p>

<p><b>group(num = 0)</b></p>

<p>This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num)</p>

<p><b>groups()</b></p>

<p>This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The search Function</h2>

<p>This function searches for first occurrence of RE <i>pattern</i> within <i>string</i> with optional <i>flags</i>.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax for this function &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>pattern</b></p>

<p>This is the regular expression to be matched.</p>

<p><b>string</b></p>

<p>This is the string, which would be searched to match the pattern anywhere in the string.</p>

<p><b>flags</b></p>

<p>You can specify different flags using bitwise OR (|). These are modifiers, which are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The <i>re.search</i> function returns a <b>match</b> object on success, <b>none</b> on failure. We use <i>group(num) </i> or <i>groups() </i> function of <b>match</b> object to get the matched expression.</p>

<p><b>group(num = 0)</b></p>

<p>This method returns entire match (or specific subgroup num)</p>

<p><b>groups()</b></p>

<p>This method returns all matching subgroups in a tuple (empty if there weren't any)</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Matching Versus Searching</h2>

<p>Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: <b>match</b> checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while <b>search</b> checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Search and Replace</h2>

<p>One of the most important <b>re</b> methods that use regular expressions is <b>sub</b>.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>This method replaces all occurrences of the RE <i>pattern</i> in <i>string</i> with <i>repl</i>, substituting all occurrences unless <i>max</i> is provided. This method returns modified string.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Regular Expression Modifiers: Option Flags</h2>

<p>Regular expression literals may include an optional modifier to control various aspects of matching. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. You can provide multiple modifiers using exclusive OR (|), as shown previously and may be represented by one of these &minus;</p>

<p><b>re.I</b></p>

<p>Performs case-insensitive matching.</p>

<p><b>re.L</b></p>

<p>Interprets words according to the current locale. This interpretation affects the alphabetic group (\w and \W), as well as word boundary behavior (\b and \B).</p>

<p><b>re.M</b></p>

<p>Makes &dollar; match the end of a line (not just the end of the string) and makes &#94; match the start of any line (not just the start of the string).</p>

<p><b>re.S</b></p>

<p>Makes a period (dot) match any character, including a newline.</p>

<p><b>re.U</b></p>

<p>Interprets letters according to the Unicode character set. This flag affects the behavior of \w, \W, \b, \B.</p>

<p><b>re.X</b></p>

<p>Permits "cuter" regular expression syntax. It ignores whitespace (except inside a set [] or when escaped by a backslash) and treats unescaped # as a comment marker.</p>

<h2>Regular Expression Patterns</h2>

<p>Except for the control characters, <b>(&plus; ? . * &#94; &dollar; ( ) [ ] { } | \)</b>, all characters match themselves. You can escape a control character by preceding it with a backslash.</p>

<p>The following table lists the regular expression syntax that is available in Python &minus;</p>

<p><b>&#94;</b></p><p>Matches beginning of line.</p>

<p><b>&dollar;</b></p><p>Matches end of line.</p>

<p><b>.</b></p><p>Matches any single character except newline. Using m option allows it to match newline as well.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - CGI Programming</h1>

<p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a set of standards that define how information is exchanged between the web server and a custom script. The CGI specs are currently maintained by the NCSA and NCSA.</p>

<h2>What is CGI?</h2>

<p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a standard for external gateway programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers.</p>

<p>The current version is CGI/1.1 and CGI/1.2 is under progress.</p>

<h2>Web Browsing</h2>

<p>To understand the concept of CGI, let us see what happens when we click a hyper link to browse a particular web page or URL.</p>

<p>Your browser contacts the HTTP web server and demands for the URL, i.e., filename.</p>

<p>Web Server parses the URL and looks for the filename. If it finds that file then sends it back to the browser, otherwise sends an error message indicating that you requested a wrong file.</p>

<p>Web browser takes response from web server and displays either the received file or error message.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever a file in a certain directory is requested that file is not sent back; instead it is executed as a program, and whatever that program outputs is sent back for your browser to display. This function is called the Common Gateway Interface or CGI and the programs are called CGI scripts. These CGI programs can be a Python Script, PERL Script, Shell Script, C or C++ program, etc.</p>

<h2>CGI Architecture Diagram</h2>

<h2>Web Server Support and Configuration</h2>

<p>By default, the Linux server is configured to run only the scripts in the cgi-bin directory in /var/www. If you want to specify any other directory to run your CGI scripts, comment the following lines in the httpd.conf file &minus;</p>

<p>Following line should also be added for apache server to treat .py file as cgi script</p>

<p>Here, we assume that you have Web Server up and running successfully and you are able to run any other CGI program like Perl or Shell, etc.</p>

<h2>First CGI Program</h2>

<p>Here is a simple link, which is linked to a CGI script called <a href="/cgi-bin/hello.py" target="_blank">hello.py</a>. This file is kept in /var/www/cgi-bin directory and it has following content. Before running your CGI program, make sure you have change mode of file using <b>chmod 755 hello.py</b> UNIX command to make file executable.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>First line in the script must be path to Python executable. In Linux it should be #!/usr/bin/python3</p>

<p>Enter following URL in yor browser</p>

<h2>Hello Word! This is my first CGI program</h2>

<p>This hello.py script is a simple Python script, which writes its output on STDOUT file, i.e., screen. There is one important and extra feature available which is first line to be printed <b>Content-type:text/html</b> followed by a blank line. This line is sent back to the browser and it specifies the content type to be displayed on the browser screen.</p>

<p>By now you must have understood basic concept of CGI and you can write many complicated CGI programs using Python. This script can interact with any other external system also to exchange information such as RDBMS.</p>

<h2>HTTP Header</h2>

<p>The line <b>Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b> is part of HTTP header which is sent to the browser to understand the content. All the HTTP header will be in the following form &minus;</p>

<p>There are few other important HTTP headers, which you will use frequently in your CGI Programming.</p>

<h2>CGI Environment Variables</h2>

<p>All the CGI programs have access to the following environment variables. These variables play an important role while writing any CGI program.</p>

<p>Here is small CGI program to list out all the CGI variables. Click this link to see the result <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/get_env.py" target="_blank">Get Environment</a></p>

<h2>GET and POST Methods</h2>

<p>You must have come across many situations when you need to pass some information from your browser to web server and ultimately to your CGI Program. Most frequently, browser uses two methods two pass this information to web server. These methods are GET Method and POST Method.</p>

<h2>Passing Information using GET method</h2>

<p>The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The GET method is the default method to pass information from browser to web server and it produces a long string that appears in your browser's Location:box. Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to pass to the server. The GET method has size limtation: only 1024 characters can be sent in a request string. The GET method sends information using QUERY_STRING header and will be accessible in your CGI Program through QUERY_STRING environment variable.</p>

<p>You can pass information by simply concatenating key and value pairs along with any URL or you can use HTML &lt;FORM&gt; tags to pass information using GET method.</p>

<h2>Simple URL Example:Get Method</h2>

<p>Here is a simple URL, which passes two values to hello_get.py program using GET method.</p>

<p>Below is <b>hello_get.py</b> script to handle input given by web browser. We are going to use <b>cgi</b> module, which makes it very easy to access passed information &minus;</p>

<p>This would generate the following result:</p>

<h2>Hello ZARA ALI</h2>

<h2>Simple FORM Example:GET Method</h2>

<p>Here is the actual output of the above form, you enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>

<h2>Passing Information Using POST Method</h2>

<p>A generally more reliable method  of passing information to a CGI program is the POST method. This packages the information in exactly the same way as GET methods, but instead of sending it as a text string after a ? in the URL it sends it as a separate message. This message comes into the CGI script in the form of the standard input.</p>

<p>Below is same hello_get.py script which handles GET as well as POST method.</p>

<p>Let us take again same example as above which passes two values using HTML FORM and submit button. We use same CGI script hello_get.py to handle this input.</p>

<p>Here is the actual output of the above form. You enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>

<h2>Passing Checkbox Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Checkboxes are used when more than one option is required to be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with two checkboxes &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the above form:</p>

<p>Below is checkbox.cgi script to handle input given by web browser for checkbox button.</p>

<h2>Passing Radio Button Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Radio Buttons are used when only one option is required to be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with two radio buttons &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is radiobutton.py script to handle input given by web browser for radio button:</p>

<h2>Passing Text Area Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>TEXTAREA element is used when multiline text has to be passed to the CGI Program.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with a TEXTAREA box &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is textarea.cgi script to handle input given by web browser &minus;</p>

<h2>Passing Drop Down Box Data to CGI Program</h2>

<p>Drop Down Box is used when we have many options available but only one or two will be selected.</p>

<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with one drop down box &minus;</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>Below is dropdown.py script to handle input given by web browser.</p>

<h2>Using Cookies in CGI</h2>

<p>HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. For a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information  among different pages. For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. How to maintain user's session information across all the web pages?</p>

<p>In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.</p>

<h2>How It Works?</h2>

<p>Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. The browser may accept the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, the cookie is available for retrieval. Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored.</p>

<p>Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields:</p>

<p><b>Expires:</b> The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p>

<p><b>Domain:</b> The domain name of your site.</p>

<p><b>Path:</b> The path to the directory or web page that sets the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.</p>

<p><b>Secure:</b> If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.</p>

<p><b>Name=Value:</b> Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key and value pairs.</p>

<h2>Setting up Cookies</h2>

<p>It is very easy to send cookies to browser. These cookies are sent along with HTTP Header before to Content-type field. Assuming you want to set UserID and Password as cookies. Setting the cookies is done as follows &minus;</p>

<p>From this example, you must have understood how to set cookies. We use <b>Set-Cookie</b> HTTP header to set cookies.</p>

<p>It is optional to set cookies attributes like Expires, Domain, and Path. It is notable that cookies are set before sending magic line <b>"Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b>.</p>

<h2>Retrieving Cookies</h2>

<p>It is very easy to retrieve all the set cookies. Cookies are stored in CGI environment variable HTTP_COOKIE and they will have following form &minus;</p>

<p>Here is an example of how to retrieve cookies.</p>

<p>This produces the following result for the cookies set by above script &minus;</p>

<h2>File Upload Example</h2>

<p>To upload a file, the HTML form must have the enctype attribute set to <b>multipart/form-data</b>. The input tag with the file type creates a "Browse" button.</p>

<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>

<p>File: <input type="file" name="filename" /></p>

<p><input type="reset" value="Upload" /></p>

<p>Above example has been disabled intentionally to save people uploading file on our server, but you can try above code with your server.</p>

<p>Here is the script <b>save_file.py</b> to handle file upload &minus;</p>

<p>If you run the above script on Unix/Linux, then you need to take care of replacing  file separator as follows, otherwise on your windows machine above open() statement should work fine.</p>

<h2>How To Raise a "File Download" Dialog Box ?</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it is desired that you want to give option where a user can click a link and it will pop up a "File Download" dialogue box to the user instead of displaying actual content. This is very easy and can be achieved through HTTP header. This HTTP header is be different from the header mentioned in previous section.</p>

<p>For example, if you want make a <b>FileName</b> file downloadable from a given link, then its syntax is as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - MySQL Database Access</h1>

<p>The Python standard for database interfaces is the Python DB-API. Most Python database interfaces adhere to this standard.</p>

<p>You can choose the right database for your application. Python Database API supports a wide range of database servers such as &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the list of available Python database interfaces &minus; <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python Database Interfaces and APIs</a>. You must download a separate DB API module for each database you need to access. For example, if you need to access an Oracle database as well as a MySQL database, you must download both the Oracle and the MySQL database modules.</p>

<p>The DB API provides a minimal standard for working with databases using Python structures and syntax wherever possible. This API includes the following:</p>

<p>Python has an in-built support for SQLite. In this section, we would learn all the concepts using MySQL. MySQLdb module, a popular interface with MySQL is not compatible with Python 3. Instead, we shall use <a href="http://www.pymysql.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PyMySQL</a> module.</p>

<h2>What is PyMySQL ?</h2>

<p>PyMySQL is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server from Python. It implements the Python Database API v2.0 and contains a pure-Python MySQL client library. The goal of PyMySQL is to be a drop-in replacement for MySQLdb .</p>

<h2>How do I Install PyMySQL?</h2>

<p>Before proceeding furthur, you make sure you have PyMySQL installed on your machine. Just type the following in your Python script and execute it &minus;</p>

<p>If it produces the following result, then it means MySQLdb module is not installed:</p>

<p>The last stable release is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip &minus;</p>

<p>Alternatively (e.g. if pip is not available), a tarball can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and installed with Setuptools as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Make sure you have root privilege to install the above module.</p>

<h2>Database Connection</h2>

<p>Before connecting to a MySQL database, make sure of the following points &minus;</p>

<p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p>

<p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p>

<p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p>

<p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p>

<p>Python module PyMySQL is installed properly on your machine.</p>

<p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial to understand <a href="/mysql/index.htm">MySQL Basics.</a></p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example of connecting with MySQL database "TESTDB" &minus;</p>

<p>While running this script, it produces the following result.</p>

<p>If a connection is established with the datasource, then a Connection Object is returned and saved into <b>db</b> for further use, otherwise <b>db</b> is set to None. Next, <b>db</b> object is used to create a <b>cursor</b> object, which in turn is used to execute SQL queries. Finally, before coming out, it ensures that the database connection is closed and resources are released.</p>

<h2>Creating Database Table</h2>

<p>Once a database connection is established, we are ready to create tables or records into the database tables using <b>execute</b> method of the created cursor.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us create a Database table EMPLOYEE &minus;</p>

<h2>INSERT Operation</h2>

<p>The INSERT Operation is required when you want to create your records into a database table.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example, executes SQL <i>INSERT</i> statement to create a record in the EMPLOYEE table &minus;</p>

<p>The above example can be written as follows to create SQL queries dynamically &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following code segment is another form of execution where you can pass parameters directly &minus;</p>

<h2>READ Operation</h2>

<p>READ Operation on any database means to fetch some useful information from the database.</p>

<p>Once the database connection is established, you are ready to make a query into this database. You can use either <b>fetchone()</b> method to fetch a single record or <b>fetchall()</b> method to fetch multiple values from a database table.</p>

<p><b>fetchone()</b> &minus; It fetches the next row of a query result set. A result set is an object that is returned when a cursor object is used to query a table.</p>

<p><b>rowcount</b> &minus; This is a read-only attribute and returns the number of rows that were affected by an execute() method.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following procedure queries all the records from EMPLOYEE table having salary more than 1000 &minus;</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Update Operation</h2>

<p>UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>

<p>The following procedure updates all the records having SEX as <b>'M'</b>. Here, we increase the AGE of all the males by one year.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>DELETE Operation</h2>

<p>DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database. Following is the  procedure to delete all the records from EMPLOYEE where AGE is more than 20 &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Performing Transactions</h2>

<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>

<p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p>

<p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p>

<p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p>

<p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p>

<p>The Python DB API 2.0 provides two methods to either <i>commit</i> or <i>rollback</i> a transaction.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You already know how to implement transactions. Here is a similar example &minus;</p>

<h2>COMMIT Operation</h2>

<p>Commit is an operation, which gives a green signal to the database to finalize the changes, and after this operation, no change can be reverted back.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>commit</b> method.</p>

<h2>ROLLBACK Operation</h2>

<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>

<h2>Disconnecting Database</h2>

<p>To disconnect the Database connection, use the close() method.</p>

<p>If the connection to a database is closed by the user with the close() method, any outstanding transactions are rolled back by the DB. However, instead of depending on any of the DB lower level implementation details, your application would be better off calling commit or rollback explicitly.</p>

<h2>Handling Errors</h2>

<p>There are many sources of errors. A few examples are a syntax error in an executed SQL statement, a connection failure, or calling the fetch method for an already canceled or finished statement handle.</p>

<p>The DB API defines a number of errors that must exist in each database module. The following table lists these exceptions.</p>

<p><b>Warning</b></p><p>Used for non-fatal issues. Must subclass StandardError.</p>

<p><b>Error</b></p><p>Base class for errors. Must subclass StandardError.</p>

<p><b>InterfaceError</b></p><p>Used for errors in the database module, not the database itself. Must subclass Error.</p>

<p><b>DatabaseError</b></p><p>Used for errors in the database. Must subclass Error.</p>

<p><b>DataError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors in the data.</p>

<p><b>OperationalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as the loss of a connection to the database. These errors are generally outside of the control of the Python scripter.</p>

<p><b>IntegrityError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError for situations that would damage the relational integrity, such as uniqueness constraints or foreign keys.</p>

<p><b>InternalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors internal to the database module, such as a cursor no longer being active.</p>

<p><b>ProgrammingError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as a bad table name and other things that can safely be blamed on you.</p>

<p><b>NotSupportedError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to trying to call unsupported functionality.</p>

<p>Your Python scripts should handle these errors, but before using any of the above exceptions, make sure your MySQLdb has support for that exception. You can get more information about them by reading the DB API 2.0 specification.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Network Programming</h1>

<p>Python provides two levels of access to the network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.</p>

<p>Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.</p>

<p>This chapter gives you an understanding on the most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.</p>

<h2>What is Sockets?</h2>

<p>Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.</p>

<p>Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The <i>socket</i> library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.</p>

<p>Sockets have their own vocabulary &minus;</p>

<p><b>domain</b></p><p>The family of protocols that is used as the transport mechanism. These values are constants such as AF_INET, PF_INET, PF_UNIX, PF_X25, and so on.</p>

<p><b>type</b></p>

<p>The type of communications between the two endpoints, typically SOCK_STREAM for connection-oriented protocols and SOCK_DGRAM for connectionless protocols.</p>

<p><b>protocol</b></p><p>Typically zero, this may be used to identify a variant of a protocol within a domain and type.</p>

<p><b>hostname</b></p><p>The identifier of a network interface &minus;</p>

<p><b>port</b></p><p>Each server listens for clients calling on one or more ports. A port may be a Fixnum port number, a string containing a port number, or the name of a service.</p>

<h2>The socket Module</h2>

<p>To create a socket, you must use the <i>socket.socket()</i> function available in the socket module, which has the general syntax &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>socket_family</b> &minus; This is either AF_UNIX or AF_INET, as explained earlier.</p>

<p><b>socket_type</b> &minus; This is either SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_DGRAM.</p>

<p><b>protocol</b> &minus; This is usually left out, defaulting to 0.</p>

<p>Once you have <i>socket</i> object, then you can use the required functions to create your client or server program. Following is the list of functions required &minus;</p>

<h2>Server Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.bind()</b></p><p>This method binds address (hostname, port number pair) to socket.</p>

<p><b>s.listen()</b></p><p>This method sets up and start TCP listener.</p>

<p><b>s.accept()</b></p><p>This passively accept TCP client connection, waiting until connection arrives (blocking).</p>

<h2>Client Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.connect()</b></p><p>This method actively initiates TCP server connection.</p>

<h2>General Socket Methods</h2>

<p><b>s.recv()</b></p><p>This method receives TCP message</p>

<p><b>s.send()</b></p><p>This method transmits TCP message</p>

<p><b>s.recvfrom()</b></p><p>This method receives UDP message</p>

<p><b>s.sendto()</b></p><p>This method transmits UDP message</p>

<p><b>s.close()</b></p><p>This method closes socket</p>

<p><b>socket.gethostname()</b></p><p>Returns the hostname.</p>

<h2>A Simple Server</h2>

<p>To write Internet servers, we use the <b>socket</b> function available in socket module to create a socket object. A socket object is then used to call other functions to setup a socket server.</p>

<p>Now call the <b>bind(hostname, port)</b> function to specify a <i>port</i> for your service on the given host.</p>

<p>Next, call the <i>accept</i> method of the returned object. This method waits until a client connects to the port you specified, and then returns a <i>connection</i> object that represents the connection to that client.</p>

<h2>A Simple Client</h2>

<p>Let us write a very simple client program which opens a connection to a given port 12345 and a given host. It is very simple to create a socket client using the Python's <i>socket</i> module function.</p>

<p>The <b>socket.connect(hosname, port )</b> opens a TCP connection to <i>hostname</i> on the <i>port</i>. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When done, remember to close it, as you would close a file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following code is a very simple client that connects to a given host and port, reads any available data from the socket, and then exits &minus;</p>

<p>Now run this server.py in the background and then run the above client.py to see the result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Python Internet Modules</h2>

<p>A list of some important modules in Python Network/Internet programming are given below &minus;</p>

<p>Please check all the libraries  mentioned above to work with FTP, SMTP, POP, and IMAP protocols.</p>

<h2>Further Readings</h2>

<p>This was a quick start with the Socket Programming. It is a vast subject. It is recommended to go through the following link to find more detail &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Sending Email using SMTP</h1>

<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending an e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. </p>

<p>Python provides <b>smtplib</b> module, which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mails to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.</p>

<p>Here is a simple syntax to create one SMTP object, which can later be used to send an e-mail &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the detail of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>host</b> &minus; This is the host running your SMTP server. You can specifiy IP address of the host or a domain name like tutorialspoint.com. This is an optional argument.</p>

<p><b>port</b> &minus; If you are providing <i>host</i> argument, then you need to specify a port, where SMTP server is listening. Usually this port would be 25.</p>

<p><b>local_hostname</b> &minus; If your SMTP server is running on your local machine, then you can specify just <i>localhost</i> the option.</p>

<p>An SMTP object has an instance method called <b>sendmail</b>, which is typically used to do the work of mailing a message. It takes three parameters &minus;</p>

<p>The <i>sender</i> &minus; A string with the address of the sender.</p>

<p>The <i>receivers</i> &minus; A list of strings, one for each recipient.</p>

<p>The <i>message</i> &minus; A message as a string formatted as specified in the various RFCs.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a simple way to send one e-mail using Python script. Try it once &minus;</p>

<p>Here, you have placed a basic e-mail in message, using a triple quote, taking care to format the headers correctly. An e-mail requires a <b>From</b>, <b>To</b>, and a <b>Subject</b> header, separated from the body of the e-mail with a blank line.</p>

<p>To send the mail you use <i>smtpObj</i> to connect to the SMTP server on the local machine. Then use the <i>sendmail</i> method along with the message, the from address, and the destination address as parameters (even though the from and to addresses are within the e-mail itself, these are not always used to route the mail).</p>

<p>If you are not running an SMTP server on your local machine, you can the use <i>smtplib</i> client to communicate with a remote SMTP server. Unless you are using a webmail service (such as gmail or Yahoo! Mail), your e-mail provider must have provided you with the outgoing mail server details that you can supply them, as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Sending an HTML e-mail using Python</h2>

<p>When you send a text message using Python, then all the content is treated as simple text. Even if you include HTML tags in a text message, it is displayed as simple text and HTML tags will not be formatted according to the HTML syntax. However, Python provides an option to send an HTML message as actual HTML message.</p>

<p>While sending an e-mail message, you can specify a Mime version, content type  and the character set to send an HTML e-mail.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example to send the HTML content as an e-mail. Try it once &minus;</p>

<h2>Sending Attachments as an E-mail</h2>

<p>To send an e-mail with mixed content requires setting the <b>Content-type</b> header to <b>multipart/mixed</b>. Then, the text and the attachment sections can be specified within <b>boundaries</b>.</p>

<p>A boundary is started with two hyphens followed by a unique number, which cannot appear in the message part of the e-mail. A final boundary denoting the e-mail's final section must also end with two hyphens.</p>

<p>The attached files should be encoded with the <b>pack("m")</b> function to have base 64 encoding before transmission.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following is an example, which sends  a file <b>/tmp/test.txt</b> as an attachment. Try it once &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Multithreaded Programming</h1>

<p>Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits &minus;</p>

<p>Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.</p>

<p>Threads are sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.</p>

<p>A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context is it currently running.</p>

<p>It can be pre-empted (interrupted).</p>

<p>It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.</p>

<p>There are two different kind of threads &minus;</p>

<p>Kernel Threads are a part of the operating system, while the User-space threads are not implemented in the kernel. </p>

<p>There are two modules which support the usage of threads in Python3 &minus;</p>

<p>The thread module has been "deprecated" for quite a long time. Users are encouraged to use the threading module instead. Hence, in Python 3, the module "thread" is not available anymore. However, it has been renamed to "_thread" for backwards compatibilities in Python3. </p>

<h2>Starting a New Thread</h2>

<p>To spawn another thread, you need to call the following method available in the <i>thread</i> module &minus;</p>

<p>This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of <i>args</i>. When the function returns, the thread terminates.</p>

<p>Here, <i>args</i> is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. <i>kwargs </i>is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<p>Program goes in an infinite loop. You will have to press ctrl-c to stop</p>

<p>Although it is very effective for low-level threading, the <i>thread</i> module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.</p>

<h2>The Threading Module</h2>

<p>The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p>The <i>threading</i> module exposes all the methods of the <i>thread</i> module and provides some additional methods &minus;</p>

<p><b>threading.activeCount()</b> &minus; Returns the number of thread objects that are active.</p>

<p><b>threading.currentThread()</b> &minus; Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.</p>

<p><b>threading.enumerate()</b> &minus; Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.</p>

<p>In addition to the methods, the threading module has the <i>Thread</i> class that implements threading. The methods provided by the <i>Thread</i> class are as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>run()</b> &minus; The run() method is the entry point for a thread.</p>

<p><b>start()</b> &minus; The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.</p>

<p><b> join([time])</b> &minus; The join() waits for threads to terminate.</p>

<p><b> isAlive()</b> &minus; The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.</p>

<p><b> getName()</b> &minus; The getName() method returns the name of a thread.</p>

<p><b> setName()</b> &minus; The setName() method sets the name of a thread.</p>

<h2>Creating Thread Using Threading Module</h2>

<p>To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following &minus;</p>

<p>Define a new subclass of the <i>Thread</i> class.</p>

<p>Override the <i>__init__(self [,args])</i> method to add additional arguments.</p>

<p>Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.</p>

<p>Once you have created the new <i>Thread</i> subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the <i>start()</i>, which in turn calls the <i>run()</i> method.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Result</h3>

<p>When we run the above program, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Synchronizing Threads</h2>

<p>The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the <i>Lock()</i> method, which returns the new lock.</p>

<p>The <i>acquire(blocking)</i> method of the new lock object is used to force the threads to run synchronously. The optional <i>blocking</i> parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.</p>

<p>If <i>blocking</i> is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.</p>

<p>The <i>release()</i> method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Multithreaded Priority Queue</h2>

<p>The <i>Queue</i> module allows you to create a new queue object that can hold a specific number of items. There are following methods to control the Queue &minus;</p>

<p><b>get()</b> &minus; The get() removes and returns an item from the queue.</p>

<p><b>put()</b> &minus; The put adds item to a queue.</p>

<p><b>qsize() </b> &minus; The qsize() returns the number of items that are currently in the queue.</p>

<p><b>empty()</b> &minus; The empty( ) returns True if queue is empty; otherwise, False.</p>

<p><b>full()</b> &minus; the full() returns True if queue is full; otherwise, False.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - XML Processing</h1>

<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of operating system and/or developmental language.</p>

<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard.</p>

<p>XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring an SQL-based backbone.</p>

<h2>XML Parser Architectures and APIs</h2>

<p>The Python standard library provides a minimal but useful set of interfaces to work with XML.</p>

<p>The two most basic and broadly used APIs to XML data are the SAX and DOM interfaces.</p>

<p><b>Simple API for XML (SAX)</b> &minus; Here, you register callbacks for events of interest and then let the parser proceed through the document. This is useful when your documents are large or you have memory limitations, it parses the file as it reads it from the disk and the entire file is never stored in the memory.</p>

<p>SAX obviously cannot process information as fast as DOM, when working with large files. On the other hand, using DOM exclusively can really kill your resources, especially if used on many small files.</p>

<p>SAX is read-only, while DOM allows changes to the XML file. Since these two different APIs literally complement each other, there is no reason why you cannot use them both for large projects.</p>

<p>For all our XML code examples, let us use a simple XML file <i>movies.xml</i> as an input &minus;</p>

<h2>Parsing XML with SAX APIs</h2>

<p>SAX is a standard interface for event-driven XML parsing. Parsing XML with SAX generally requires you to create your own ContentHandler by subclassing xml.sax.ContentHandler.</p>

<p>Your <i>ContentHandler</i> handles the particular tags and attributes of your flavor(s) of XML. A ContentHandler object provides methods to handle various parsing events. Its owning parser calls ContentHandler methods as it parses the XML file.</p>

<p>The methods <i>startDocument</i> and <i>endDocument</i> are called at the start and the end of the XML file. The method <i>characters(text)</i> is passed the character data of the XML file via the parameter text.</p>

<p>The ContentHandler is called at the start and end of each element. If the parser is not in namespace mode, the methods <i>startElement(tag, attributes)</i> and <i>endElement(tag)</i> are called; otherwise, the corresponding methods <i>startElementNS</i> and <i>endElementNS</i> are called. Here, tag is the element tag, and attributes is an Attributes object.</p>

<p>Here are other important methods to understand before proceeding &minus;</p>

<h2>The make_parser Method</h2>

<p>The following method creates a new parser object and returns it. The parser object created will be of the first parser type, the system finds.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>parser_list</b> &minus; The optional argument consisting of a list of parsers to use which must all implement the make_parser method.</p>

<h2>The parse Method</h2>

<p>The following method creates a SAX parser and uses it to parse a document.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>xmlfile</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML file to read from.</p>

<p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p>

<p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p>

<h2>The parseString Method</h2>

<p>There is one more method to create a SAX parser and to parse the specified <b>XML string</b>.</p>

<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>

<p><b>xmlstring</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML string to read from.</p>

<p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p>

<p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>For a complete detail on SAX API documentation, please refer to the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/xml.sax.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python SAX APIs</a>.</p>

<h2>Parsing XML with DOM APIs</h2>

<p>The Document Object Model ("DOM") is a cross-language API from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying the XML documents.</p>

<p>The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications. SAX only allows you a view of one bit of the document at a time. If you are looking at one SAX element, you have no access to another.</p>

<p>Here is the easiest way to load an XML document quickly and to create a minidom object using the xml.dom module. The minidom object provides a simple parser method that quickly creates a DOM tree from the XML file.</p>

<p>The sample phrase calls the parse( file [,parser] ) function of the minidom object to parse the XML file, designated by file into a DOM tree object.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<p>For a complete detail on DOM API documentation, please refer to the standard <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/xml.dom.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python DOM APIs</a>.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - GUI Programming (Tkinter)</h1>

<p>Python provides various options for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The most important features are listed below.</p>

<p><b>Tkinter</b> &minus; Tkinter is the Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. We would look this option in this chapter.</p>

<p><b>wxPython</b> &minus; This is an open-source Python interface for wxWidgets GUI toolkit. You can find a complete tutorial on WxPython <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/wxpython/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>PyQt</b> &minus;This is also a Python interface for a popular cross-platform Qt GUI library. TutorialsPoint has a very good tutorial on PyQt <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>JPython</b> &minus; JPython is a Python port for Java which gives Python scripts seamless access to the Java class libraries on the local machine <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jython.org" target="_blank">http://www.jython.org</a>.</p>

<p>There are many other interfaces available, which you can find them on the net.</p>

<h2>Tkinter Programming</h2>

<p>Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.</p>

<p>Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps &minus;</p>

<p>Import the <i>Tkinter</i> module.</p>

<p>Create the GUI application main window.</p>

<p>Add one or more of the above-mentioned widgets to the GUI application.</p>

<p>Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>This would create a following window &minus;</p>

<h2>Tkinter Widgets</h2>

<p>Tkinter provides various controls, such as buttons, labels and text boxes used in a GUI application. These controls are commonly called widgets.</p>

<p>There are currently 15 types of widgets in Tkinter. We present these widgets as well as a brief description in the following table &minus;</p>

<p>The Button widget is used to display buttons in your application.</p>

<p>The Canvas widget is used to draw shapes, such as lines, ovals, polygons and rectangles, in your application.</p>

<p>The Checkbutton widget is used to display a number of options as checkboxes. The user can select multiple options at a time.</p>

<p>The Entry widget is used to display a single-line text field for accepting values from a user.</p>

<p>The Frame widget is used as a container widget to organize other widgets.</p>

<p>The Label widget is used to provide a single-line caption for other widgets. It can also contain images.</p>

<p>The Listbox widget is used to provide a list of options to a user.</p>

<p>The Menubutton widget is used to display menus in your application.</p>

<p>The Menu widget is used to provide various commands to a user. These commands are contained inside Menubutton.</p>

<p>The Message widget is used to display multiline text fields for accepting values from a user.</p>

<p>The Radiobutton widget is used to display a number of options as radio buttons. The user can select only one option at a time.</p>

<p>The Scale widget is used to provide a slider widget.</p>

<p>The Scrollbar widget is used to add scrolling capability to various widgets, such as list boxes.</p>

<p>The Text widget is used to display text in multiple lines.</p>

<p>The Toplevel widget is used to provide a separate window container.</p>

<p>The Spinbox widget is a variant of the standard Tkinter Entry widget, which can be used to select from a fixed number of values.</p>

<p>A PanedWindow is a container widget that may contain any number of panes, arranged horizontally or vertically.</p>

<p>A labelframe is a simple container widget. Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer or container for complex window layouts.</p>

<p>This module is used to display message boxes in your applications.</p>

<h2>Standard attributes</h2>

<p>Let us look at how some of their common attributes, such as sizes, colors and fonts are specified.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_dimensions.htm">Dimensions</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_colors.htm">Colors</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_fonts.htm">Fonts</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_bitmaps.htm">Bitmaps</a></p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_cursors.htm">Cursors</a></p>

<h2>Geometry Management</h2>

<p>All Tkinter widgets have access to the specific geometry management methods, which have the purpose of organizing widgets throughout the parent widget area. Tkinter exposes the following geometry manager classes: pack, grid, and place.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_pack.htm">The pack() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets in blocks before placing them in the parent widget.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_grid.htm">The grid() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets in a table-like structure in the parent widget.</p>

<p><a href="/python3/tk_place.htm">The place() Method</a> &minus; This geometry manager organizes widgets by placing them in a specific position in the parent widget.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Extension Programming with C</h1>

<p>Any code that you write using any compiled language like C, C&plus;&plus;, or Java can be integrated or imported into another Python script. This code is considered as an "extension."</p>

<p>A Python extension module is nothing more than a normal C library. On Unix machines, these libraries usually end in <b>.so</b> (for shared object). On Windows machines, you typically see <b>.dll</b> (for dynamically linked library).</p>

<h2>Pre-Requisites for Writing Extensions</h2>

<p>To start writing your extension, you are going to need the Python header files.</p>

<p>On Unix machines, this usually requires installing a developer-specific package such as <a href="https://packages.debian.org/etch-m68k/python2.5-dev" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">python2.5-dev</a>.</p>

<p>Windows users get these headers as part of the package when they use the binary Python installer.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is assumed that you have a good knowledge of C or C&plus;&plus; to write any Python Extension using C programming.</p>

<h2>First look at a Python Extension</h2>

<p>For your first look at a Python extension module, you need to group your code into four part &minus;</p>

<p>The header file <i>Python.h</i>.</p>

<p>The C functions you want to expose as the interface from your module.</p>

<p>A table mapping the names of your functions as Python developers see them as C functions inside the extension module.</p>

<p>An initialization function.</p>

<h2>The Header File Python.h</h2>

<p>You need to include <i>Python.h</i> header file in your C source file, which gives you the access to the internal Python API used to hook your module into the interpreter.</p>

<p>Make sure to include Python.h before any other headers you might need. You need to follow the includes with the functions you want to call from Python.</p>

<h2>The C Functions</h2>

<p>The signatures of the C implementation of your functions always takes one of the following three forms &minus;</p>

<p>Each one of the preceding declarations returns a Python object. There is no such thing as a <i>void </i> function in Python as there is in C. If you do not want your functions to return a value, return the C equivalent of Python's <b>None</b> value. The Python headers define a macro, Py_RETURN_NONE, that does this for us.</p>

<p>The names of your C functions can be whatever you like as they are never seen outside of the extension module. They are defined as <i>static</i> function.</p>

<p>Your C functions usually are named by combining the Python module and function names together, as shown here &minus;</p>

<p>This is a Python function called <i>func</i> inside the module <i>module</i>. You will be putting pointers to your C functions into the method table for the module that usually comes next in your source code.</p>

<h2>The Method Mapping Table</h2>

<p>This method table is a simple array of PyMethodDef structures. That structure looks something like this &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of the members of this structure &minus;</p>

<p><b>ml_name</b> &minus; This is the name of the function as the Python interpreter presents when it is used in Python programs.</p>

<p><b>ml_meth</b> &minus; This is the address of a function that has any one of the signatures described in the previous section.</p>

<p><b>ml_flags</b> &minus; This tells the interpreter which of the three signatures ml_meth is using.</p>

<p>This flag usually has a value of METH_VARARGS.</p>

<p>This flag can be bitwise OR'ed with METH_KEYWORDS if you want to allow keyword arguments into your function.</p>

<p>This can also have a value of METH_NOARGS that indicates you do not want to accept any arguments.</p>

<p><b>ml_doc</b> &minus; This is the docstring for the function, which could be NULL if you do not feel like writing one.</p>

<p>This table needs to be terminated with a sentinel that consists of NULL and 0 values for the appropriate members.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>For the above-defined function, we have the following method mapping table &minus;</p>

<h2>The Initialization Function</h2>

<p>The last part of your extension module is the initialization function. This function is called by the Python interpreter when the module is loaded. It is required that the function be named <b>init<i>Module</i></b>, where <i>Module</i> is the name of the module.</p>

<p>The initialization function needs to be exported from the library you will be building. The Python headers define PyMODINIT_FUNC to include the appropriate incantations for that to happen for the particular environment in which we are compiling. All you have to do is use it when defining the function.</p>

<p>Your C initialization function generally has the following overall structure &minus;</p>

<p>Here is the description of <b>Py_InitModule3</b> function &minus;</p>

<p><b>func</b> &minus; This is the function to be exported.</p>

<p><b>module_methods</b> &minus; This is the mapping table name defined above.</p>

<p><b>docstring</b> &minus; This is the comment you want to give in your extension.</p>

<p>Putting all this together, it looks like the following &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>A simple example that makes use of all the above concepts &minus;</p>

<p>Here the <i>Py_BuildValue</i> function is used to build a Python value. Save above code in hello.c file. We would see how to compile and install this module to be called from Python script.</p>

<h2>Building and Installing Extensions:</h2>

<p>The <i>distutils</i> package makes it very easy to distribute Python modules, both pure Python and extension modules, in a standard way. Modules are distributed in the source form, built and installed via a setup script usually called <i>setup.py</i> as.</p>

<p>For the above module, you need to prepare the following setup.py script &minus;</p>

<p>Now, use the following command, which would perform all needed compilation and linking steps, with the right compiler and linker commands and flags, and copies the resulting dynamic library into an appropriate directory &minus;</p>

<p>On Unix-based systems, you will most likely need to run this command as root in order to have permissions to write to the site-packages directory. This usually is not a problem on Windows.</p>

<h2>Importing Extensions</h2>

<p>Once you install your extensions, you would be able to import and call that extension in your Python script as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>Passing Function Parameters</h2>

<p>As you will most likely want to define functions that accept arguments, you can use one of the other signatures for your C functions. For example, the following function, that accepts some number of parameters, would be defined like this &minus;</p>

<p>The method table containing an entry for the new function would look like this &minus;</p>

<p>You can use the API <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> function to extract the arguments from the one PyObject pointer passed into your C function.</p>

<p>The first argument to PyArg_ParseTuple is the args argument. This is the object you will be <i>parsing</i>. The second argument is a format string describing the arguments as you expect them to appear. Each argument is represented by one or more characters in the format string as follows.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Compiling the new version of your module and importing it enables you to invoke the new function with any number of arguments of any type &minus;</p>

<p>You can probably come up with even more variations.</p>

<h2>The PyArg_ParseTuple Function</h2>

<p>Here is the standard signature for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>This function returns 0 for errors, and a value not equal to 0 for success. Tuple is the PyObject* that was the C function's second argument. Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes mandatory and optional arguments.</p>

<p>Here is a list of format codes for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>

<h2>Returning Values</h2>

<p><i>Py_BuildValue</i> takes in a format string much like <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> does. Instead of passing in the addresses of the values you are building, you pass in the actual values. Here is an example showing how to implement an add function &minus;</p>

<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>

<p>You can return two values from your function as follows. This would be captured using a list in Python.</p>

<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>Py_BuildValue</i> Function:</h2>

<p>Here is the standard signature for <b>Py_BuildValue</b> function &minus;</p>

<p>Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes the Python object to build. The following arguments of <i>Py_BuildValue</i> are C values from which the result is built. The <i>PyObject*</i> result is a new reference.</p>

<p>The following table lists the commonly used code strings, of which zero or more are joined into a string format.</p>

<p>Code {...} builds dictionaries from an even number of C values, alternately keys and values. For example, Py_BuildValue("{issi}",23,"zig","zag",42) returns a dictionary like Python's {23:'zig','zag':42}.</p>

from __future__ import division
</pre>
<h2>The print Function</h2>
<p>Most notable and most widely known change in Python 3 is how the <b>print</b> function is used. Use of parenthesis () with print function is now mandatory. It was optional in Python 2.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
print "Hello World" #is acceptable in Python 2
print ("Hello World") # in Python 3, print must be followed by ()
</pre>
<p>The print() function inserts a new line at the end, by default. In Python 2, it can be suppressed by putting ',' at the end. In Python 3, "end =' '" appends space instead of newline.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
print x,           # Trailing comma suppresses newline in Python 2
print(x, end=" ")  # Appends a space instead of a newline in Python 3
</pre>
<h2>Reading Input from Keyboard</h2>
<p>Python 2 has two versions of input functions, <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b>. The input() function treats the received data as string if it is included in quotes '' or "", otherwise the data is treated as number.</p>
<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Further, the received data is always treated as string.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
In Python 2

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input('something:') 
something:10 #entered data is treated as number
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
10

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input('something:')
something:'10' #eentered data is treated as string
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'10'

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = raw_input("something:")
something:10 #entered data is treated as string even without ''
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'10'

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = raw_input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string including ''
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
"'10'"

In Python 3

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:10
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'10'

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
"'10'"

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = raw_input("something:") # will result NameError
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "&lt;pyshell#3&gt;", line 1, in 
  &lt;module&gt;
   x = raw_input("something:")
NameError: name 'raw_input' is not defined
</pre>
<h2>Integer Division</h2>
<p>In Python 2, the result of division of two integers is rounded to the nearest integer. As a result, 3/2 will show 1. In order to obtain a floating-point division, numerator or denominator must be explicitly used as float. Hence, either 3.0/2 or 3/2.0 or 3.0/2.0 will result in 1.5</p>
<p>Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.</p>
<h2>Unicode Representation</h2>
<p>Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a u if you want to store it as Unicode. </p>
<p>Python 3 stores strings as Unicode, by default. We have Unicode (utf-8) strings, and 2 byte classes: byte and byte arrays.</p>
<h2>xrange() Function Removed</h2>
<p>In Python 2 range() returns a list, and xrange() returns an object that will only generate the items in the range when needed, saving memory.</p>
<p>In Python 3, the range() function is removed, and xrange() has been renamed as range(). In addition, the range() object supports slicing in Python 3.2 and later.</p>
<h2>raise exceprion</h2>
<p>Python 2 accepts both notations, the 'old' and the 'new' syntax; Python 3 raises a SyntaxError if we do not enclose the exception argument in parenthesis.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
raise IOError, "file error" #This is accepted in Python 2
raise IOError("file error") #This is also accepted in Python 2
raise IOError, "file error" #syntax error is raised in Python 3
raise IOError("file error") #this is the recommended syntax in Python 3
</pre>
<h2>Arguments in Exceptions</h2>
<p>In Python 3, arguments to exception should be declared with 'as' keyword.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
except Myerror, err: # In Python2
except Myerror as err: #In Python 3
</pre>
<h2>next() Function and .next() Method</h2>
<p>In Python 2, next() as a method of generator object, is allowed. In Python 2, the next() function, to iterate over generator object, is also accepted. In Python 3, however, next(0 as a generator method is discontinued and raises <b>AttributeError</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
gen = (letter for letter in 'Hello World') # creates generator object
next(my_generator) #allowed in Python 2 and Python 3
my_generator.next() #allowed in Python 2. raises AttributeError in Python 3
</pre>
<h2>2to3 Utility</h2>
<p>Along with Python 3 interpreter, 2to3.py script is usually installed in tools/scripts folder. It reads Python 2.x source code and applies a series of fixers to transform it into a valid Python 3.x code.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Here is a sample Python 2 code (area.py):

def area(x,y = 3.14): 
   a = y*x*x
   print a
   return a

a = area(10)
print "area",a

To convert into Python 3 version:

$2to3 -w area.py

Converted code :

def area(x,y = 3.14): # formal parameters
   a = y*x*x
   print (a)
   return a

a = area(10)
print("area",a)
</pre>
<h1>Python 3 - Overview</h1>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently whereas the other languages use punctuations. It has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

<li><p>Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.</p></li>
<li><p>Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p></li>
<li><p>Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.</p></li>
<li><p>Python 1.0 was released in November 1994. In 2000, Python 2.0 was released. Python 2.7.11 is the latest edition of Python 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile, Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2. The emphasis in Python 3 had been on the removal of duplicate programming constructs and modules so that "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." Python 3.5.1 is the latest version of Python 3.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting up PATH</h2>
<p>Programs and other executable files can be in many directories. Hence, the operating systems provide a search path that lists the directories that it searches for executables.</p>
<p>The important features are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The path is stored in an environment variable, which is a named string maintained by the operating system. This variable contains information available to the command shell and other programs.</p></li>
<li><p>The path variable is named as <b>PATH</b> in Unix or <b>Path</b> in Windows (Unix is case-sensitive; Windows is not).</p></li>
<li><p>In Mac OS, the installer handles the path details. To invoke the Python interpreter from any particular directory, you must add the Python directory to your path.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting Path at Unix/Linux</h2>
<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Unix &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>In the csh shell</b> &minus; type setenv PATH "$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>In the bash shell (Linux)</b> &minus; type export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/bin/python3.4 and press Enter.</p></li>
<li><p><b>In the sh or ksh shell</b> &minus; type PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin/python3" and press Enter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note &minus; </b> /usr/local/bin/python3 is the path of the Python directory.</p>
<h2>Setting Path at Windows</h2>
<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Windows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>At the command prompt</b> &minus; type path %path%;C:\Python and press Enter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; C:\Python is the path of the Python directory </p>
<h2>Python Environment Variables</h2>
<p>Here are important environment variables, which are recognized by Python &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.No.</th><th style="text-align:center;">Variable &amp; Description</th></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1</td><td><p><b>PYTHONPATH</b></p><p>It has a role similar to PATH. This variable tells the Python interpreter where to locate the module files imported into a program. It should include the Python source library directory and the directories containing Python source code. PYTHONPATH is sometimes preset by the Python installer.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2</td><td><p><b>PYTHONSTARTUP</b></p><p>It contains the path of an initialization file containing Python source code. It is executed every time you start the interpreter. It is named as .pythonrc.py in Unix and it contains commands that load utilities or modify PYTHONPATH.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3</td><td><p><b>PYTHONCASEOK</b></p><p>It is used in Windows to instruct Python to find the first case-insensitive match in an import statement. Set this variable to any value to activate it.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">4</td><td><p><b>PYTHONHOME</b></p><p>It is an alternative module search path. It is usually embedded in the PYTHONSTARTUP or PYTHONPATH directories to make switching module libraries easy.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Running Python</h2>
<p>There are three different ways to start Python &minus;</p>
<h3>Interactive Interpreter</h3>
<p>You can start Python from Unix, DOS, or any other system that provides you a command-line interpreter or shell window.</p>
<p>Enter <b>python</b> the command line.</p>
<p>Start coding right away in the interactive interpreter.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$python             # Unix/Linux

or 

python%             # Unix/Linux

<h3>Script from the Command-line</h3>
<p>A Python script can be executed at the command line by invoking the interpreter on your application, as shown in the following example.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$python  script.py          # Unix/Linux

or 

python% script.py           # Unix/Linux

C:&gt;python script.py         # Windows/DOS
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Be sure the file permission mode allows execution.</p>
<h3>Integrated Development Environment</h3>
<p>You can run Python from a Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment as well, if you have a GUI application on your system that supports Python.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Unix</b> &minus; IDLE is the very first Unix IDE for Python.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Windows</b> &minus; <b>PythonWin</b> is the first Windows interface for Python and is an IDE with a GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Macintosh</b> &minus; The Macintosh version of Python  along with the IDLE IDE is available from the main website, downloadable as either MacBinary or BinHex'd files.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not able to set up the environment properly, then you can take the help of your system admin. Make sure the Python environment is properly set up and working perfectly fine.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; All the examples given in subsequent chapters are executed with Python 3.4.1 version available on Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Basic Syntax</h1>
<p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>
<h2>First Python Program</h2>
<p>Let us execute the programs in different modes of programming.</p>
<h3>Interactive Mode Programming</h3>
<p>Invoking the interpreter without passing a script file as a parameter brings up the following prompt &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python

Python 3.3.2 (default, Dec 10 2013, 11:35:01)
[GCC 4.6.3] on Linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits", or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;

On Windows:

Python 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 24 2015, 22:43:06) [MSC v.1600 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Type the following text at the Python prompt and press Enter &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print ("Hello, Python!")
</pre>
<p>If you are running the older version of Python (Python 2.x), use of parenthesis as <b>inprint</b> function is optional. This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Hello, Python!
</pre>
<h3>Script Mode Programming</h3>
<p>Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins execution of the script and continues until the script is finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is no longer active.</p>
<p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python files have the extension <b>.py</b>. Type the following source code in a test.py file &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
print ("Hello, Python!")
</pre>
<p>We assume that you have the Python interpreter set in <b>PATH</b> variable. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>On Linux</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python test.py 
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notanslate">
Hello, Python!
</pre>
<p><b>On Windows</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
C:\Python34&gt;Python test.py
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notanslate">
Hello, Python!
</pre>
<p>Let us try another way to execute a Python script in Linux. Here is the modified test.py file &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
print ("Hello, Python!")
</pre>
<p>We assume that you have Python interpreter available in the /usr/bin directory. Now, try to run this program as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ chmod +x test.py     # This is to make file executable
$./test.py
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result">
Hello, Python!
</pre>
<h2>Python Identifiers</h2>
<p>A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).</p>
<p>Python does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Python is a case sensitive programming language. Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in Python.</p>
<p>Here are naming conventions for Python identifiers &minus;<p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Class names start with an uppercase letter. All other identifiers start with a lowercase letter.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates that the identifier is private.</p></li>
<li><p>Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strong private identifier.</p></li>
<li><p>If the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Reserved Words</h2>
<p>The following list shows the Python keywords. These are reserved words and you cannot use them as constants or variables or any other identifier names. All the Python keywords contain lowercase letters only.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr>
<td>and</td><td>exec</td><td>not</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>as</td><td>finally</td><td>or</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>assert</td><td>for</td><td>pass</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>break</td><td>from</td><td>print</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>class</td><td>global</td><td>raise</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>continue</td><td>if</td><td>return</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>def</td><td>import</td><td>try</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>del</td><td>in</td><td>while</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>elif</td><td>is</td><td>with </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>else</td>
<td>lambda</td>
<td>yield</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>except</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Lines and Indentation</h2>
<p>Python does not use braces({}) to indicate blocks of code for class and function definitions or flow control. Blocks of code are denoted by line indentation, which is rigidly enforced.</p>
<p>The number of spaces in the indentation is variable, but all statements within the block must be indented the same amount. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
if True:
   print ("True")

else:
   print ("False")
</pre>
<p>However, the following block generates an error &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
if True:
   print ("Answer")
   print ("True")

else:
   print "(Answer")
   print ("False")
</pre>
<p>Thus, in Python all the continuous lines indented with the same number of spaces would form a block. The following example has various statement blocks &minus;</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Do not try to understand the logic at this point of time. Just make sure you understood the various blocks even if they are without braces.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import sys

try:
   # open file stream
   file = open(file_name, "w")

except IOError:
   print ("There was an error writing to", file_name)
   sys.exit()
print ("Enter '", file_finish,)
print "' When finished"
while file_text != file_finish:
   file_text = raw_input("Enter text: ")
   if file_text == file_finish:
      # close the file
	  file.close
      break
  file.write(file_text)
  file.write("\n")
file.close()
file_name = input("Enter filename: ")
if len(file_name) == 0:
   print ("Next time please enter something")
   sys.exit()

try:
   file = open(file_name, "r")

except IOError:
   print ("There was an error reading file")
   sys.exit()
file_text = file.read()
file.close()
print (file_text)
</pre>
<h2>Multi-Line Statements</h2>
<p>Statements in Python typically end with a new line. Python, however, allows the use of the line continuation character (\) to denote that the line should continue. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
total = item_one + \
        item_two + \
        item_three
</pre>
<p>The statements contained within the [], {}, or () brackets do not need to use the line continuation character. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
</pre>
<h2>Quotation in Python</h2>
<p>Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.</p>
<p>The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
word = 'word'
sentence = "This is a sentence."
paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""
</pre>
<h2>Comments in Python</h2>
<p>A hash sign (#) that is not inside a string literal is the beginning of a comment. All characters after the #, up to the end of the physical line, are part of the comment and the Python interpreter ignores them.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# First comment
print ("Hello, Python!") # second comment
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Hello, Python!
</pre>
<p>You can type a comment on the same line after a statement or expression &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
name = "Madisetti" # This is again comment
</pre>
<p>Python does not have multiple-line commenting feature. You have to comment each line individually as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# This is a comment.
# This is a comment, too.
# This is a comment, too.
# I said that already.
</pre>
<h2>Using Blank Lines</h2>
<p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line and Python totally ignores it.</p>
<p>In an interactive interpreter session, you must enter an empty physical line to terminate a multiline statement.</p>
<h2>Waiting for the User</h2>
<p>The following line of the program displays the prompt and, the statement saying “Press the enter key to exit”, and then waits for the user to take action &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

input("\n\nPress the enter key to exit.")
</pre>
<p>Here, "\n\n" is used to create two new lines before displaying the actual line. Once the user presses the key, the program ends. This is a nice trick to keep a console window open until the user is done with an application.</p>
<h2>Multiple Statements on a Single Line</h2>
<p>The semicolon ( ; ) allows multiple statements on a single line given that no statement starts a new code block. Here is a sample snip using the semicolon &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
import sys; x = 'foo'; sys.stdout.write(x + '\n')
</pre>
<h2>Multiple Statement Groups as Suites</h2>
<p>Groups of individual statements, which make a single code block are called <b>suites</b> in Python. Compound or complex statements, such as if, while, def, and class require a header line and a suite.</p>
<p>Header lines begin the statement (with the keyword) and terminate with a colon ( : ) and are followed by one or more lines which make up the suite. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
if expression : 
   suite
elif expression : 
   suite 
else : 
   suite
</pre>
<h2>Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>Many programs can be run to provide you with some basic information about how they should be run. Python enables you to do this with -<b>h</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python -h
usage: python [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : debug output from parser (also PYTHONDEBUG=x)
-E     : ignore environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit

[ etc. ]
</pre>
<p>You can also program your script in such a way that it should accept various options. <a href="/python3/python_command_line_arguments.htm">Command Line Arguments</a> is an advanced topic. Let us understand it.</p> 
<h1>Python 3 - Variable Types</h1>
<p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. It means that when you create a variable, you reserve some space in the memory.</p>
<p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to the variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
<h2>Assigning Values to Variables</h2>
<p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.</p>
<p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

counter = 100          # An integer assignment
miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
name    = "John"       # A string

print (counter)
print (miles)
print (name)
</pre>
<p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and  "John" are the values assigned to counter, miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
100
1000.0
John
</pre>
<h2>Multiple Assignment</h2>
<p>Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously.</p>
<p>For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
a = b = c = 1
</pre>
<p>Here, an integer object is created with the value 1, and all the three variables are assigned to the same memory location. You can also assign multiple objects to multiple variables. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
	a, b, c = 1, 2, "john"
</pre>
<p>Here, two integer objects with values 1 and 2 are assigned to the variables a and b respectively, and one string object with the value "john" is assigned to the variable c.</p>
<h2>Standard Data Types</h2>
<p>The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.</p>
<p>Python has five standard data types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>String</p></li>
<li><p>List</p></li>
<li><p>Tuple</p></li>
<li><p>Dictionary</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="/python3/python_numbers.htm">Python Numbers</a></h2>
<p>Number data types store numeric values. Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var1 = 1
var2 = 10
</pre>
<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
</pre>
<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement.</p>
<p>For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var
del var_a, var_b
</pre>
<p>Python supports three different numerical types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>int (signed integers)</p></li>
<li><p>float (floating point real values)</p></li>
<li><p>complex (complex numbers)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All integers in Python3 are represented as long integers. Hence, there is no separate number type as long.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some examples of numbers &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align:center;">
<tr><th>int</th><th>float</th><th>complex</th></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>0.0</td><td>3.14j</td></tr>
<tr><td>100</td><td>15.20</td><td>45.j</td></tr>
<tr><td>-786</td><td>-21.9</td><td>9.322e-36j</td></tr>
<tr><td>080</td><td>32.3&plus;e18</td><td>.876j</td></tr>
<tr><td>-0490</td><td>-90.</td><td>-.6545&plus;0J</td></tr>
<tr><td>-0x260</td><td>-32.54e100</td><td>3e&plus;26J</td></tr>
<tr><td>0x69</td><td>70.2-E12</td><td>4.53e-7j</td></tr>
</table>
<p>A complex number consists of an ordered pair of real floating-point numbers denoted by x &plus; yj, where x and y are real numbers and j is the imaginary unit.</p>
<h2><a href="/python3/python_strings.htm">Python Strings</a></h2>
<p>Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks. Python allows either pair of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ([ ] and [:] ) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 to the end.</p>
<p>The plus (&plus;) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

str = 'Hello World!'

print (str)          # Prints complete string
print (str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print (str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print (str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print (str * 2)      # Prints string two times
print (str &plus; "TEST") # Prints concatenated string
</pre>
<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello World!
H
llo
llo World!
Hello World!Hello World!
Hello World!TEST
</pre>
<h2><a href="/python3/python_lists.htm">Python Lists</a></h2>
<p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. One of the differences between them is that all the items belonging to a list can be of different data type.</p>
<p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (&plus;) sign is the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the repetition operator. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
tinylist = [123, 'john']

print (list)          # Prints complete list
print (list[0])       # Prints first element of the list
print (list[1:3])     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
print (list[2:])      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
print (tinylist * 2)  # Prints list two times
print (list &plus; tinylist) # Prints concatenated lists
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
abcd
[786, 2.23]
[2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003]
[123, 'john', 123, 'john']
['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.200000000000003, 123, 'john']
</pre>
<h2><a href="/python3/python_tuples.htm">Python Tuples</a></h2>
<p>A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are enclosed within parenthesis.</p>
<p>The main difference between lists and tuples are &minus; Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as <b>read-only</b> lists. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

<h2><a href="/python3/python_dictionary.htm">Python Dictionary</a></h2>
<p>Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.</p>
<p>Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]). For example &minus;</p>

<p>Dictionaries have no concept of order among the elements. It is incorrect to say that the elements are "out of order"; they are simply unordered.</p>
<h2>Data Type Conversion</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you may need to perform conversions between the built-in types. To convert between types, you simply use the type-names as a function.</p>
<p>There are several built-in functions to perform conversion from one data type to another. These functions return a new object representing the converted value.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Loops</h1>
<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially &minus; The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following diagram illustrates a loop statement &minus;</p>
<img src="/python3/images/loop_architecture.jpg" alt="Loop Architecture" />
<p>Python programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>The Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When the execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly.</p>
<h2>Iterator and Generator</h2>
<p><b>Iterator</b> is an object which allows a programmer to traverse through all the elements of a collection, regardless of its specific implementation. In Python, an iterator object implements two methods, <b>iter()</b> and <b>next()</b>.</p>
<p>String, List or Tuple objects can be used to create an Iterator.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
list = [1,2,3,4]
it = iter(list) # this builds an iterator object
print (next(it)) #prints next available element in iterator
Iterator object can be traversed using regular for statement
!usr/bin/python3
for x in it:
   print (x, end=" ")
or using next() function
while True:
   try:
      print (next(it))
   except StopIteration:
      sys.exit() #you have to import sys module for this
</pre>
<p>A <b>generator</b> is a function that produces or yields a sequence of values using yield method.</p> 
<p>When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object without even beginning execution of the function. When the next() method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches the yield statement, which returns the yielded value. The yield keeps track i.e. remembers the last execution and the second next() call continues from previous value.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example defines a generator, which generates an iterator for all the Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
!usr/bin/python3
import sys
def fibonacci(n): #generator function
   a, b, counter = 0, 1, 0
   while True:
      if (counter &gt; n): 
         return
      yield a
      a, b = b, a + b
      counter += 1
f = fibonacci(5) #f is iterator object

while True:
   try:
      print (next(f), end=" ")
   except StopIteration:
      sys.exit()
</pre>
<h1>Python 3 - Numbers</h1>
<p>Number data types store numeric values. They are immutable data types. This means, changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.</p>
<p>Number objects are created when you assign a value to them. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var1 = 1
var2 = 10
</pre>
<p>You can also delete the reference to a number object by using the <b>del</b> statement. The syntax of the <b>del</b> statement is &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var1[,var2[,var3[....,varN]]]]
</pre>
<p>You can delete a single object or multiple objects by using the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
del var
del var_a, var_b
</pre>
<p>Python supports  different numerical types &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>int (signed integers)</b> &minus; They are often called just integers or <b>ints</b>. They are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point. Integers in Python 3 are of unlimited size. Python 2 has two integer types - int and long. There is no '<b>long integer</b>' in Python 3 anymore.
</p></li>
<li><p><b>float (floating point real values)</b> &minus; Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and the fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 10<sup>2</sup> = 250).
</p></li>
<li><p><b>complex (complex numbers)</b> &minus; are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to represent an integer in hexa-decimal or octal form</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
&gt;&gt;&gt; number = 0xA0F #Hexa-decimal
&gt;&gt;&gt; number
2575

&gt;&gt;&gt; number = 0o37 #Octal
&gt;&gt;&gt; number
31

<h2>Number Type Conversion</h2>
<p>Python converts numbers internally in an expression containing mixed types to a common type for evaluation. Sometimes, you need to coerce a number explicitly from one type to another to satisfy the requirements of an operator or function parameter.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Type <b>int(x)</b> to convert x to a plain integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <b>long(x)</b> to convert x to a long integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <b>float(x)</b> to convert x to a floating-point number.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <b>complex(x)</b> to convert x to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part zero.</p></li>
<li><p>Type <b>complex(x, y)</b> to convert x and y to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part y. x and y are numeric expressions</p></li>

<h1>Python 3 - Strings</h1>
<p>Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
var1 = 'Hello World!'
var2 = "Python Programming"
</pre>
<h2>Accessing Values in Strings</h2>
<p>Python does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring.</p>
<p>To access substrings, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain your substring. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

var1 = 'Hello World!'
var2 = "Python Programming"

print ("var1[0]: ", var1[0])
print ("var2[1:5]: ", var2[1:5])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
var1[0]:  H
var2[1:5]:  ytho
</pre>
<h2>Updating Strings</h2>
<p>You can "update" an existing string by (re)assigning a variable to another string. The new value can be related to its previous value or to a completely different string altogether. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

var1 = 'Hello World!'

print ("Updated String :- ", var1[:6] + 'Python')
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Updated String :-  Hello Python

<h2>Triple Quotes</h2>
<p>Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines, including verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.</p>
<p>The syntax for triple quotes consists of three consecutive <b>single or double</b> quotes.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

para_str = """this is a long string that is made up of
several lines and non-printable characters such as

this within the brackets [ \n ], or just a NEWLINE within
the variable assignment will also show up.
"""
print (para_str)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result. Note how every single special character has been converted to its printed form, right down to the last NEWLINE at the end of the string between the "up." and closing triple quotes.

<h2>Unicode String</h2>

<h1>Python 3 - Lists</h1>
<p>The most basic data structure in Python is the <b>sequence</b>. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.</p>
<p>Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.</p>
<p>There are certain things you can do with all the sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.</p>
<h2>Python Lists</h2>
<p>The list is the most versatile datatype available in Python, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that the items in a list need not be of the same type.</p>
<p>Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
</pre>
<p>Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be sliced, concatenated and so on.</p>
<h2>Accessing Values in Lists</h2>
<p>To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]

print ("list1[0]: ", list1[0])
print ("list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
list1[0]:  physics
list2[1:5]:  [2, 3, 4, 5]
</pre>
<h2>Updating Lists</h2>
<p>You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append() method. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]
print ("Value available at index 2 : ", list[2])

list[2] = 2001
print ("New value available at index 2 : ", list[2])
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The append() method is discussed in the subsequent section.<p>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value available at index 2 :  1997
New value available at index 2 :  2001
</pre>
<h2>Delete List Elements</h2>
<p>To remove a list element, you can use either the <b>del</b> statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting. You can use the remove() method if you do not know exactly which items to delete. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]

print (list)
del list[2]
print ("After deleting value at index 2 : ", list)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]
After deleting value at index 2 :  ['physics', 'chemistry', 2000]
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>
<h2>Basic List Operations</h2>
<p>Lists respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.</p>
<p>In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior chapter.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Tuples</h1>
<p>A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The main difference between the tuples and the lists is that the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists. Tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.</p>
<p>Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally, you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 )
tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d"
</pre>
<p>The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
tup1 = ();
</pre>
<p>To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
tup1 = (50,)
</pre>
<p>Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.</p>
<h2>Accessing Values in Tuples</h2>
<p>To access values in tuple, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain the value available at that index. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )

print ("tup1[0]: ", tup1[0])
print ("tup2[1:5]: ", tup2[1:5])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
tup1[0]:  physics
tup2[1:5]:  (2, 3, 4, 5)
</pre>
<h2>Updating Tuples</h2>
<p>Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example demonstrates &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

tup1 = (12, 34.56)
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz')

# Following action is not valid for tuples
# tup1[0] = 100;

# So let's create a new tuple as follows
tup3 = tup1 + tup2
print (tup3)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
(12, 34.56, 'abc', 'xyz')
</pre>
<h2>Delete Tuple Elements</h2>
<p>Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with putting together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.</p>
<p>To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the <b>del</b> statement. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

tup = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);

print (tup)
del tup;
print "After deleting tup : "
print tup
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; An exception is raised. This is because after <b>del tup</b>, tuple does not exist any more.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
After deleting tup :

<h2>Basic Tuples Operations</h2>
<p>Tuples respond to the &plus; and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.</p>
<p>In fact, tuples respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the previous chapter.</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Dictionary</h1>
<p>Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.</p>
<p>Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>
<h2>Accessing Values in Dictionary</h2>
<p>To access dictionary elements, you can use the familiar square brackets along with the key to obtain its value. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])
print ("dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dict['Name']:  Zara
dict['Age']:  7
</pre>
<p>If we attempt to access a data item with a key, which is not a part of the dictionary, we get an error as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'};
print "dict['Alice']: ", dict['Alice']
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dict['Zara']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
      print "dict['Alice']: ", dict['Alice'];
KeyError: 'Alice'
</pre>
<h2>Updating Dictionary</h2>
<p>You can update a dictionary by adding a new entry or a key-value pair, modifying an existing entry, or deleting an existing entry as shown in a simple example given below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
dict['Age'] = 8; # update existing entry
dict['School'] = "DPS School" # Add new entry

print ("dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'])
print ("dict['School']: ", dict['School'])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dict['Age']:  8
dict['School']:  DPS School
</pre>
<h2>Delete Dictionary Elements</h2>
<p>You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation.</p>
<p>To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the <b>del</b> statement. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}

del dict['Name'] # remove entry with key 'Name'
dict.clear()     # remove all entries in dict
del dict         # delete entire dictionary

print ("dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'])
print ("dict['School']: ", dict['School'])
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result.</p>
<p>An exception is raised because after <b>del dict</b>, the dictionary does not exist anymore.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dict['Age']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
      print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'];
TypeError: 'type' object is unsubscriptable
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; The del() method is discussed in subsequent section.</p>
<h2>Properties of Dictionary Keys</h2>
<p>Dictionary values have no restrictions. They can be any arbitrary Python object, either standard objects or user-defined objects. However, same is not true for the keys.</p>
<p>There are two important points to remember about dictionary keys &minus;</p>
<p><b>(a)</b> More than one entry per key is not allowed. This means no duplicate key is allowed. When duplicate keys are encountered during assignment, the last assignment wins. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Name': 'Manni'}
print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dict['Name']:  Manni
</pre>
<p></p>
<p><b>(b)</b> Keys must be immutable. This means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

dict = {['Name']: 'Zara', 'Age': 7}
print ("dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'])

<h1>Python 3 - Date &amp; Time</h1>
<p>A Python program can handle date and time in several ways. Converting between date formats is a common chore for computers. Python's time and calendar modules help track dates and times.</p>
<h2>What is Tick?</h2>
<p>Time intervals are floating-point numbers in units of seconds. Particular instants in time are expressed in seconds since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>
<p>There is a popular <b>time</b> module available in Python which provides functions for working with times, and for converting between representations. The function <b>time.time()</b> returns the current system time in ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970(epoch).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import time;  # This is required to include time module.

ticks = time.time()
print ("Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970:", ticks)
</pre>
<p>This would produce a result something as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Number of ticks since 12:00am, January 1, 1970: 1455508609.34375
</pre>
<p>Date arithmetic is easy to do with ticks. However, dates before the epoch cannot be represented in this form. Dates in the far future also cannot be represented this way - the cutoff point is sometime in 2038 for UNIX and Windows.</p>
<h2>What is TimeTuple?</h2>

<h2>The calendar Module</h2>
<p>The calendar module supplies calendar-related functions, including functions to print a text calendar for a given month or year.</p>

<h2>Other Modules and Functions</h2>
<p>If you are interested, then here you would find a list of other important modules and functions to play with date &amp; time in Python &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">

</ul>
<h1>Python 3 - Functions</h1>
<p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
<p>As you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. but you can also create your own functions. These functions are called <i>user-defined functions.</i></p>
<h3>Defining a Function</h3>
<p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Function blocks begin with the keyword <b>def</b> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</p></li>
<li><p>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or <i>docstring</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</p></li>
<li><p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def functionname( parameters ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
</pre>
<p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print (str)
   return
</pre>
<h2>Calling a Function</h2>
<p>Defining a function gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>
<p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is an example to call the <b>printme()</b> function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print (str)
   return

# Now you can call printme function
printme("This is first call to the user defined function!")
printme("Again second call to the same function")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is first call to the user defined function!
Again second call to the same function
</pre>
<h2>Pass by Reference vs Value</h2>
<p>All parameters (arguments) in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"
   print ("Values inside the function before change: ", mylist)
   mylist[2]=50
   print ("Values inside the function after change: ", mylist)
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30]
changeme( mylist )
print ("Values outside the function: ", mylist)
</pre>
<p>Here, we are maintaining reference of the passed object and appending values in the same object. Therefore, this would produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Values inside the function before change:  [10, 20, 30]
Values inside the function after change:  [10, 20, 50]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 50]
</pre>
<p>There is one more example where argument is being passed by reference and the reference is being overwritten inside the called function.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def changeme( mylist ):
   "This changes a passed list into this function"
   mylist = [1,2,3,4] # This would assi new reference in mylist
   print ("Values inside the function: ", mylist)
   return

# Now you can call changeme function
mylist = [10,20,30]
changeme( mylist )
print ("Values outside the function: ", mylist)
</pre>
<p>The parameter <b>mylist</b> is local to the function changeme. Changing mylist within the function does not affect mylist. The function accomplishes nothing and finally this would produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Values inside the function:  [1, 2, 3, 4]
Values outside the function:  [10, 20, 30]
</pre>
<h2>Function Arguments</h2>
<p>You can call a function by using the following types of formal arguments &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Required arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Keyword arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Default arguments</p></li>
<li><p>Variable-length arguments</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Arguments</h2>
<p>Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order. Here, the number of arguments in the function call should match exactly with the function definition.</p>
<p>To call the function <b>printme()</b>, you definitely need to pass one argument, otherwise it gives a syntax error as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print (str)
   return

# Now you can call printme function
printme()
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
      printme();
TypeError: printme() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)
</pre>
<h2>Keyword Arguments</h2>
<p>Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.</p>
<p>This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. You can also make keyword calls to the <b>printme()</b> function in the following ways &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printme( str ):
   "This prints a passed string into this function"
   print (str)
   return

# Now you can call printme function
printme( str = "My string")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
My string
</pre>
<p>The following example gives a clearer picture. Note that the order of parameters does not matter.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printinfo( name, age ):
   "This prints a passed info into this function"
   print ("Name: ", name)
   print ("Age ", age)
   return

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( age = 50, name = "miki" )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name:  miki
Age  50
</pre>
<h2>Default Arguments</h2>
<p>A default argument is an argument that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. The following example gives an idea on default arguments, it prints default age if it is not passed &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printinfo( name, age = 35 ):
   "This prints a passed info into this function"
   print ("Name: ", name)
   print ("Age ", age)
   return

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( age = 50, name = "miki" )
printinfo( name = "miki" )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name:  miki
Age  50
Name:  miki
Age  35
</pre>
<h2>Variable-length Arguments</h2>
<p>You may need to process a function for more arguments than you specified while defining the function. These arguments are called <i>variable-length</i> arguments and are not named in the function definition, unlike required and default arguments.</p>
<p>Syntax for a function with non-keyword variable arguments is given below &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def functionname([formal_args,] *var_args_tuple ):
   "function_docstring"
   function_suite
   return [expression]
</pre>
<p>An asterisk (*) is placed before the variable name that holds the values of all nonkeyword variable arguments. This tuple remains empty if no additional arguments are specified during the function call. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def printinfo( arg1, *vartuple ):
   "This prints a variable passed arguments"
   print ("Output is: ")
   print (arg1)
   for var in vartuple:
      print (var)
   return

# Now you can call printinfo function
printinfo( 10 )
printinfo( 70, 60, 50 )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Output is:
10
Output is:
70
60
50
</pre>
<h2>The Anonymous Functions</h2>
<p>These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the <b>def</b> keyword. You can use the <b>lambda</b> keyword to create small anonymous functions.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.</p></li>
<li><p>An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression.</p></li>
<li><p>Lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it appears that lambdas are a one-line version of a function, they are not equivalent to inline statements in C or C++, whose purpose is to stack allocation by passing function, during invocation for performance reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The syntax of <b>lambda</b> functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
lambda [arg1 [,arg2,.....argn]]:expression
</pre>
<p>Following is an example to show how <b>lambda</b> form of function works &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2


# Now you can call sum as a function
print ("Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 ))
print ("Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 ))
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Value of total :  30
Value of total :  40
</pre>
<h2>The return Statement</h2>
<p>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>
<p>All the examples given below are not returning any value. You can return a value from a function as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Function definition is here
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Add both the parameters and return them."
   total = arg1 + arg2
   print ("Inside the function : ", total)
   return total

# Now you can call sum function
total = sum( 10, 20 )
print ("Outside the function : ", total )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Inside the function :  30
Outside the function :  30
</pre>
<h2>Scope of Variables</h2>
<p>All variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program. This depends on where you have declared a variable.</p>
<p>The scope of a variable determines the portion of the program where you can access a particular identifier. There are two basic scopes of variables in Python &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Global variables</p></li>
<li><p>Local variables</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Global vs. Local variables</h2>
<p>Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.</p>
<p>This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body by all functions. When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

total = 0 # This is global variable.
# Function definition is here
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   # Add both the parameters and return them."
   total = arg1 + arg2; # Here total is local variable.
   print ("Inside the function local total : ", total)
   return total

# Now you can call sum function
sum( 10, 20 )
print ("Outside the function global total : ", total )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Inside the function local total :  30
Outside the function global total :  0
</pre>
<h1>Python 3 - Modules</h1>
<p>A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.</p>
<p>Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The Python code for a module named aname normally resides in a file namedaname.py. Here is an example of a simple module, support.py &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="hello">
def print_func( par ):
   print "Hello : ", par
   return
</pre>
<h2>The import Statement</h2>
<p>You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file. The <b>import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
import module1[, module2[,... moduleN]
</pre>
<p>When the interpreter encounters an import statement, it imports the module if the module is present in the search path. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches before importing a module. For example, to import the module hello.py, you need to put the following command at the top of the script &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import module support
import support

# Now you can call defined function that module as follows
support.print_func("Zara")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello : Zara
</pre>
<p>A module is loaded only once, regardless of the number of times it is imported. This prevents the module execution from happening repeatedly, if multiple imports occur.</p>
<h2>The from...import Statement</h2>
<p>Python's <b>from</b> statement lets you import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace. The <b>from...import</b> has the following syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from modname import name1[, name2[, ... nameN]]
</pre>
<p>For example, to import the function fibonacci from the module fib, use the following statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n
   result = []
   a, b = 0, 1
   while b &lt; n:
      result.append(b)
      a, b = b, a + b
   return result
&gt;&gt;&gt; from fib import fib
&gt;&gt;&gt; fib(100)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
</pre>
<p>This statement does not import the entire module fib into the current namespace; it just introduces the item fibonacci from the module fib into the global symbol
table of the importing module.</p>
<h2>The from...import * Statement</h2>
<p>It is also possible to import all the names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from modname import *
</pre>
<p>This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.</p>
<h2>Executing Modules as Scripts</h2>
<p>Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable __name__. The code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the __name__ set to "__main__".</p>
<p>Add this code at the end of your module &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n): # return Fibonacci series up to n
   result = []
   a, b = 0, 1
   while b &lt; n:
      result.append(b)
      a, b = b, a + b
   return result
if __name__ == "__main__":
   f = fib(100)
   print(f)
</pre>
<p>When you run the above code, the following output will be displayed.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
</pre>
<h2>Locating Modules</h2>
<p>When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The current directory.</p></li>
<li><p>If the module is not found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.</p></li>
<li><p>If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python3/.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the <b>sys.path</b> variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.</p>
<h2>The PYTHONPATH Variable</h2>
<p>The PYTHONPATH is an environment variable, consisting of a list of directories. The syntax of PYTHONPATH is the same as that of the shell variable PATH.</p>
<p>Here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a Windows system &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
set PYTHONPATH = c:\python34\lib;
</pre>
<p>And here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a UNIX system &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
set PYTHONPATH = /usr/local/lib/python
</pre>
<h2>Namespaces and Scoping</h2>
<p>Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. A <i>namespace</i> is a dictionary of variable names (keys) and their corresponding objects (values).</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A Python statement can access variables in a <i>local namespace</i> and in the <i>global namespace</i>. If a local and a global variable have the same name, the local variable shadows the global variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Each function has its own local namespace. Class methods follow the same scoping rule as ordinary functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Python makes educated guesses on whether variables are local or global. It assumes that any variable assigned a value in a function is local.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore, in order to assign a value to a global variable within a function, you must first use the global statement.</p></li>
<li>The statement <i>global VarName</i> tells Python that VarName is a global variable. Python stops searching the local namespace for the variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, we define a variable <i>Money</i> in the global namespace. Within the function Money, we assign Money a value,  therefore Python assumes Money as a local variable.</p>
<p>However, we accessed the value of the local variable <i>Money</i> before setting it, so an UnboundLocalError is the result. Uncommenting the global statement fixes the problem.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

Money = 2000
def AddMoney():
   # Uncomment the following line to fix the code:
   # global Money
   Money = Money + 1

print (Money)
AddMoney()
print (Money)
</pre>
<h2>The dir( ) Function</h2>
<p>The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module.</p>
<p>The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module. Following is a simple example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import built-in module math
import math

content = dir(math)

print (content)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', 'acos', 'asin', 'atan', 
'atan2', 'ceil', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'exp', 
'fabs', 'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'hypot', 'ldexp', 'log',
'log10', 'modf', 'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 
'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh']
</pre>
<p>Here, the special string variable __name__ is the module's name, and  __file__ is the filename from which the module was loaded.</p>
<h2>The globals() and locals() Functions</h2>
<p>The <b>globals()</b> and <b>locals()</b> functions can be used to return the names in the global and local namespaces depending on the location from where they are called.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>If <b>locals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed locally from that function.</p></li>
<li><p>If <b>globals()</b> is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed globally from that function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The return type of both these functions is dictionary. Therefore, names can be extracted using the <b>keys()</b> function.</p>
<h2>The reload() Function</h2>
<p>When a module is imported into a script, the code in the top-level portion of a module is executed only once.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to reexecute the top-level code in a module, you can use the <i>reload()</i> function. The reload() function imports a previously imported module again. The syntax of the reload() function is this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
reload(module_name)
</pre>
<p>Here, module_name is the name of the module you want to reload and not the string containing the module name. For example, to reload hello module, do the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
reload(hello)
</pre>
<h2>Packages in Python</h2>
<p>A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.</p>
<p>Consider a file <i>Pots.py</i>  available in Phone directory. This file has the following line of source code &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

def Pots():
print ("I'm Pots Phone")  
</pre>
<p>Similar, we have other two files having different functions with the same name as above. They are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><i>Phone/Isdn.py</i> file having function Isdn()</p></li>
<li><p><i>Phone/G3.py</i> file having function G3()</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, create one more file __init__.py in the <i>Phone</i> directory &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Phone/__init__.py</li>
</ul>
<p>To make all of your functions available when you have imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from Pots import Pots
from Isdn import Isdn
from G3 import G3
</pre>
<p>After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Now import your Phone Package.
import Phone

Phone.Pots()
Phone.Isdn()
Phone.G3()
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
I'm Pots Phone
I'm 3G Phone
I'm ISDN Phone
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we have taken example of a single function in each file,  but you can keep multiple functions in your files. You can also define different Python classes in those files and then you can create your packages out of those classes.</p>
<h1>Python 3 - Files I/O</h1>
<p>This chapter covers all the basic I/O functions available in Python 3. For more functions, please refer to the standard Python documentation.</p>
<h2>Printing to the Screen</h2>
<p>The simplest way to produce output is using the <i>print</i> statement where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and writes the result to standard output as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

print ("Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?")
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result on your standard screen &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Python is really a great language, isn't it?
</pre>
<h2>Reading Keyboard Input</h2>
<p>Python 2 has two built-in functions to read data from standard input, which by default comes from the keyboard. These functions are <b>input()</b> and <b>raw_input()</b></p>
<p>In Python 3, raw_input() function is deprecated. Moreover, input() functions read data from keyboard as string, irrespective of whether it is enclosed with quotes ('' or "" ) or not.</p>
<h2>The input Function</h2>
<p>The <b>input([prompt])</b> function is equivalent to raw_input, except that it assumes that the input is a valid Python expression and returns the evaluated result to you.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:10

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
'10'

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = input("something:")
something:'10' #entered data treated as string with or without ''

&gt;&gt;&gt; x
"'10'"
</pre>
<h2>Opening and Closing Files</h2>
<p>Until now, you have been reading and writing to the standard input and output. Now, we will see how to use actual data files.</p>
<p>Python provides basic functions and methods necessary to manipulate files by default. You can do most of the file manipulation using a <b>file</b> object.</p>
<h2>The open Function</h2>
<p>Before you can read or write a file, you have to open it using Python's built-in open() function. This function creates a <b>file</b> object, which would be utilized to call other support methods associated with it.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])
</pre>
<p>Here are parameter details &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>file_name</b> &minus; The file_name argument is a string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access.</p></li>
<li><p><b>access_mode</b> &minus; The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is an optional parameter and the default file access mode is read (r).</p></li>
<li><p><b>buffering</b> &minus; If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering  takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of the different modes of opening a file &minus;</p>

<h2>The file Object Attributes</h2>
<p>Once a file is opened and you have one <i>file</i> object, you can get various information related to that file.</p>
<p>Here is a list of all the attributes related to a file object &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Attribute &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3</td>
<td><p><b>file.name</b></p>
<p>Returns name of the file.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; softspace attribute is not supported in Python 3.x</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)
print ("Closed or not : ", fo.closed)
print ("Opening mode : ", fo.mode)
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name of the file:  foo.txt
Closed or not :  False
Opening mode :  wb

</pre>
<h2>The close() Method</h2>
<p>The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.</p>
<p>Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.close();
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "wb")
print ("Name of the file: ", fo.name)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name of the file:  foo.txt
</pre>
<h2>Reading and Writing Files</h2>
<p>The file object provides a set of access methods to make our lives easier. We would see how to use <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b> methods to read and write files.</p>
<h2>The write() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>write()</b> method writes any string to an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data and not just text.</p>
<p>The write() method does not add a newline character ('\n') to the end of the string &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.write(string);
</pre>
<p>Here, passed parameter is the content to be written into the opened file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "w")
fo.write( "Python is a great language.\nYeah its great!!\n")

# Close opend file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>The above method would create foo.txt file and would write given content in that file and finally it would close that file. If you would open this file, it would have the following content &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Python is a great language.
Yeah its great!!
</pre>
<h2>The read() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>read()</b> method reads a string from an open file. It is important to note that Python strings can have binary data. apart from text data.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fileObject.read([count]);
</pre>
<p>Here, passed parameter is the number of bytes to be read from the opened file. This method starts reading from the beginning of the file and if <i>count</i> is missing, then it tries to read as much as possible, maybe until the end of file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>File Positions</h2>
<p>The <i>tell()</i> method tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.</p>
<p>The <i>seek(offset[, from])</i> method changes the current file position. The <b>offset</b> argument indicates the number of bytes to be moved. The <b>from</b> argument specifies the reference position from where the bytes are to be moved.</p>
<p>If <i>from</i> is set to 0, the beginning of the file is used as the reference position. If it is set to 1, the current position is used as the reference position. If it is set to 2 then the end of the file would be taken as the reference position.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p> Let us take a file <i>foo.txt</i>, which we created above.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Open a file
fo = open("foo.txt", "r+")
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Read String is : ", str)

# Check current position
position = fo.tell()
print ("Current file position : ", position)

# Reposition pointer at the beginning once again
position = fo.seek(0, 0)
str = fo.read(10)
print ("Again read String is : ", str)

# Close opened file
fo.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Read String is :  Python is
Current file position :  10
Again read String is :  Python is
</pre>
<h2>Renaming and Deleting Files</h2>
<p>Python <b>os</b> module provides methods that help you perform file-processing operations, such as renaming and deleting files.</p>
<p>To use this module, you need to import it first and then you can call any related functions.</p>
<h2>The rename() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>rename()</b> method takes two arguments, the current filename and the new filename.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.rename(current_file_name, new_file_name)
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to rename an existing file <i>test1.txt</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Rename a file from test1.txt to test2.txt
os.rename( "test1.txt", "test2.txt" )
</pre>
<h2>The remove() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>remove()</b> method to delete files by supplying the name of the file to be deleted as the argument.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.remove(file_name)
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to delete an existing file <i>test2.txt</i> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Delete file test2.txt
os.remove("text2.txt")
</pre>
<h2>Directories in Python</h2>
<p>All files are contained within various directories, and Python has no problem handling these too. The <b>os</b> module has several methods that help you create, remove, and change directories.</p>
<h2>The mkdir() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <b>mkdir()</b> method of the <b>os</b> module to create directories in the current directory. You need to supply an argument to this method, which contains the name of the directory to be created.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.mkdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to create a directory <i>test</i> in the current directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Create a directory "test"
os.mkdir("test")
</pre>
<h2>The chdir() Method</h2>
<p>You can use the <i>chdir()</i> method to change the current directory. The chdir() method takes an argument, which is the name of the directory that you want to make the current directory.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.chdir("newdir")
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to go into "/home/newdir" directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# Changing a directory to "/home/newdir"
os.chdir("/home/newdir")
</pre>
<h2>The getcwd() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>getcwd()</b> method displays the current working directory.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.getcwd()
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to give current directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would give location of the current directory
os.getcwd()
</pre>
<h2>The rmdir() Method</h2>
<p>The <b>rmdir()</b> method deletes the directory, which is passed as an argument in the method.</p>
<p>Before removing a directory, all the contents in it should be removed.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
os.rmdir('dirname')
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to remove the "/tmp/test" directory. It is required to give fully qualified name of the directory, otherwise it would search for that directory in the current directory.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import os

# This would  remove "/tmp/test"  directory.
os.rmdir( "/tmp/test"  )
</pre>
<h2>File and Directory Related Methods</h2>
<p>There are three important sources, which provide a wide range of utility methods to handle and manipulate files &amp; directories on Windows and Unix operating systems. They are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><a href="/python3/file_methods.htm">File Object Methods</a></p> 
<p>The <b>file</b> object provides functions to manipulate files.</p></li>

<h2><a name="assertion_python">Assertions in Python</a></h2>
<p>An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a <b>raise-if</b> statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.</p></li>
<li><p>Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, introduced in version 1.5.</p></li>
<li><p>Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, and after a function call to check for valid output.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>The assert Statement</h3>
<p>When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises an <i>AssertionError</i> exception.</p>
<p>The syntax for assert is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
assert Expression[, Arguments]
</pre>
<p>If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other exception, using the try-except statement. If they are not handled, they will terminate the program and produce a traceback.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a function that converts a given temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit. Since 0° K is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it sees a negative temperature &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
def KelvinToFahrenheit(Temperature):
   assert (Temperature &gt;= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
   return ((Temperature-273)*1.8)+32

print (KelvinToFahrenheit(273))
print (int(KelvinToFahrenheit(505.78)))
print (KelvinToFahrenheit(-5))
</pre>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
32.0
451
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "test.py", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;
print KelvinToFahrenheit(-5)
File "test.py", line 4, in KelvinToFahrenheit
assert (Temperature &gt;= 0),"Colder than absolute zero!"
AssertionError: Colder than absolute zero!
</pre>
<h2>What is Exception?</h2>
<p>An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.</p>
<p>When a Python script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immediately otherwise it terminates and quits.</p>
<h2>Handling an exception</h2>
<p>If you have some <i>suspicious</i> code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a <b>try:</b> block. After the try: block, include an <b>except:</b> statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Here is simple syntax of <i>try....except...else</i> blocks &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionI:
   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
except ExceptionII:
   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
</pre>
<p>Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.</p></li>
<li><p>After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.</p></li>
<li><p>The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This example opens a file, writes content in the, file and comes out gracefully because there is no problem at all &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully")
   fh.close()
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Written content in the file successfully
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This example tries to open a file where you do not have the write permission, so it raises an exception &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "r")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
else:
   print ("Written content in the file successfully")
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Error: can't find file or read data
</pre>
<h2>The except Clause with No Exceptions</h2>
<p>You can also use the except statement with no exceptions defined as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except:
   If there is any exception, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
</pre>
<p>This kind of a <b>try-except</b> statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.</p>
<h2>The except Clause with Multiple Exceptions</h2>
<p>You can also use the same <i>except</i> statement to handle multiple exceptions as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except(Exception1[, Exception2[,...ExceptionN]]]):
   If there is any exception from the given exception list, 
   then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
</pre>
<h2>The try-finally Clause</h2>
<p>You can use a <b>finally:</b> block along with a <b>try:</b> block. The <b>finally:</b> block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; You can provide except clause(s), or a finally clause, but not both. You cannot use <i>else</i> clause as well along with a finally clause.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
finally:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
   fh.close()
</pre>
<p>If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Error: can't find file or read data
</pre>
<p>Same example can be written more cleanly as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   try:
      fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
   finally:
      print ("Going to close the file")
      fh.close()
except IOError:
   print ("Error: can\'t find file or read data")
</pre>
<p>When an exception is thrown in the <i>try</i> block, the execution immediately passes to the <i>finally</i> block. After all the statements in the <i>finally</i> block are executed, the exception is raised again and is handled in the <i>except</i> statements if present in the next higher layer of the <i>try-except</i> statement.</p>
<h2>Argument of an Exception</h2>
<p>An exception can have an <i>argument</i>, which is a value that gives additional information about the problem. The contents  of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable in the except clause as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   You do your operations here
   ......................
except ExceptionType as Argument:
   You can print value of Argument here...
</pre>
<p>If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.</p>
<p>This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error string, the error number, and an error location.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example for a single exception &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Define a function here.
def temp_convert(var):
   try:
      return int(var)
   except ValueError as Argument:
      print ("The argument does not contain numbers\n", Argument)

# Call above function here.
temp_convert("xyz")
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The argument does not contain numbers
invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz'
</pre>
<h2>Raising an Exception</h2>
<p>You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the <b>raise</b> statement is as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
</pre>
<p>Here, <i>Exception</i> is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and <i>argument</i> is a value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.</p>
<p>The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either as a class object or a simple string. For example, to capture the above exception, we must write the except clause as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   Business Logic here...
except Exception as e:
   Exception handling here using e.args...
else:
   Rest of the code here...
</pre>
<p>The following example illustrates the use of raising an exception &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
def functionName( level ):
   if level &lt;1:
      raise Exception(level)
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
   return level

try:
   l = functionName(-10)
   print ("level = ",l)
except Exception as e:
   print ("error in level argument",e.args[0])
</pre>
<p>This will produce the following result</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
error in level argument -10
</pre>
<h2>User-Defined Exceptions</h2>
<p>Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.</p>
<p>Here is an example related to <i>RuntimeError</i>. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from <i>RuntimeError</i>. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.</p>
<p>In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class <i>Networkerror</i>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
   def __init__(self, arg):
      self.args = arg
</pre>
<p>So once you have defined the above class, you can raise the exception as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
try:
   raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
except Networkerror,e:
   print e.args
</pre>
<h1>Python 3 - Object Oriented</h1>
<p>Python has been an object-oriented language since the time it existed. Due to this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.</p>
<p>If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.</p>
<p>However, here is a small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to help you &minus;</p>
<h2>Overview of OOP Terminology</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Class</b> &minus; A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Class variable</b> &minus; A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Data member</b> &minus; A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Function overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Instance variable</b> &minus; A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Inheritance</b> &minus; The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Instance</b> &minus;  An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Instantiation</b> &minus; The creation of an instance of a class. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Method </b> &minus; A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Object</b> &minus; A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Operator overloading</b> &minus; The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Classes</h2>
<p>The <i>class</i> statement creates a new class definition. The name of the class immediately follows the keyword <i>class</i> followed by a colon as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
class ClassName:
   'Optional class documentation string'
   class_suite
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The class has a documentation string, which can be accessed via <i><b>ClassName.__doc__</b></i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i><b>class_suite</b></i> consists of all the component statements defining class members, data attributes and functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example of a simple Python class &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1
   
   def displayCount(self):
     print "Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print "Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary
</pre>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The variable <i>empCount</i> is a class variable whose value is shared among all the instances of a in this class. This can be accessed as <i>Employee.empCount</i> from inside the class or outside the class.</p></li>
<li><p>The first method <i>__init__()</i> is a special method, which is called class constructor or initialization method that Python calls when you create a new instance of this class.</p></li>
<li><p>You declare other class methods like normal functions with the exception that the first argument to each method is <i>self</i>. Python adds the <i>self</i> argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating Instance Objects</h2>
<p>To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its <i>__init__</i> method accepts.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
This would create first object of Employee class
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
This would create second object of Employee class
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)
</pre>
<h2>Accessing Attributes</h2>
<p>You access the object's attributes using the dot operator with object. Class variable would be accessed using class name as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
emp1.displayEmployee()
emp2.displayEmployee()
print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)
</pre>
<p>Now, putting all  the concepts together &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1
   
   def displayCount(self):
     print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print ("Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary)


#This would create first object of Employee class"
emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
#This would create second object of Employee class"
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)
emp1.displayEmployee()
emp2.displayEmployee()
print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Name :  Zara ,Salary:  2000
Name :  Manni ,Salary:  5000
Total Employee 2
</pre>
<p>You can add, remove, or modify attributes of classes and objects at any time &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
emp1.salary = 7000  # Add an 'salary' attribute.
emp1.name = 'xyz'  # Modify 'age' attribute.
del emp1.salary  # Delete 'age' attribute.
</pre>
<p>Instead of using the normal statements to access attributes, you can use the following functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>getattr(obj, name[, default])</b> &minus; to access the attribute of object.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>hasattr(obj,name)</b> &minus; to check if an attribute exists or not.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>setattr(obj,name,value)</b> &minus; to set an attribute. If attribute does not exist, then it would be created.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>delattr(obj, name)</b> &minus; to delete an attribute.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
hasattr(emp1, 'salary')    # Returns true if 'salary' attribute exists
getattr(emp1, 'salary')    # Returns value of 'salary' attribute
setattr(emp1, 'salary', 7000) # Set attribute 'salary' at 7000
delattr(emp1, 'salary')    # Delete attribute 'salary'
</pre>
<h2>Built-In Class Attributes</h2>
<p>Every Python class keeps following built-in attributes and they can be accessed using dot operator like any other attribute &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>__dict__</b> &minus; Dictionary containing the class's namespace.</p></li>
<li><p><b>__doc__</b> &minus; Class documentation string or none, if undefined. </p></li>
<li><p><b>__name__</b> &minus; Class name. </p></li>
<li><p><b>__module__</b> &minus; Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode. </p></li>
<li><p><b>__bases__</b> &minus; A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the above class let us try to access all these attributes &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Employee:
   'Common base class for all employees'
   empCount = 0

   def __init__(self, name, salary):
      self.name = name
      self.salary = salary
      Employee.empCount += 1
   
   def displayCount(self):
     print ("Total Employee %d" % Employee.empCount)

   def displayEmployee(self):
      print ("Name : ", self.name,  ", Salary: ", self.salary)

emp1 = Employee("Zara", 2000)
emp2 = Employee("Manni", 5000)
print ("Employee.__doc__:", Employee.__doc__)
print ("Employee.__name__:", Employee.__name__)
print ("Employee.__module__:", Employee.__module__)
print ("Employee.__bases__:", Employee.__bases__)
print ("Employee.__dict__:", Employee.__dict__ )
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Employee.__doc__: Common base class for all employees
Employee.__name__: Employee
Employee.__module__: __main__
Employee.__bases__: (&lt;class 'object'&gt;,)

   &lt;attribute '__weakref__' of 'Employee' objects&gt;, '__dict__': 
   &lt;attribute '__dict__' of 'Employee' objects&gt;
}
</pre>
<h2>Destroying Objects (Garbage Collection)</h2>
<p>Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space. The process by which Python periodically reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is termed as Garbage Collection.</p>
<p>Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that point to it changes.</p>
<p>An object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container (list, tuple, or dictionary). The object's reference count decreases when it is deleted with <i>del</i>, its reference is reassigned, or its reference goes out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero, Python collects it automatically.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
a = 40      # Create object &lt;40&gt;
b = a       # Increase ref. count  of &lt;40&gt; 
c = [b]     # Increase ref. count  of &lt;40&gt; 

del a       # Decrease ref. count  of &lt;40&gt;
b = 100     # Decrease ref. count  of &lt;40&gt; 
c[0] = -1   # Decrease ref. count  of &lt;40&gt; 
</pre>
<p>You normally will not notice when the garbage collector destroys an orphaned instance and reclaims its space. However, a class can implement the special method <i>__del__()</i>, called a destructor, that is invoked when the instance is about to be destroyed. This method might be used to clean up any non-memory resources used by an instance.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>This __del__() destructor prints the class name of an instance that is about to be destroyed &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Point:
   def __init__( self, x=0, y=0):
      self.x = x
      self.y = y
   def __del__(self):
      class_name = self.__class__.__name__
      print (class_name, "destroyed")

pt1 = Point()
pt2 = pt1
pt3 = pt1
print (id(pt1), id(pt2), id(pt3));   # prints the ids of the obejcts
del pt1
del pt2
del pt3
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
3083401324 3083401324 3083401324
Point destroyed
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Ideally, you should define your classes in a separate file, then you should import them in your main program file using <i>import</i> statement.</p>
<p>In the above example, assuming definition of a Point class is contained in <i>point.py</i> and there is no other executable code in it.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import point
p1 = point.Point()
</pre>
<h2>Class Inheritance</h2>
<p>Instead of starting from a scratch, you can create a class by deriving it from a pre-existing class by listing the parent class in parentheses after the new class name.</p>
<p>The child class inherits the attributes of its parent class, and you can use those attributes as if they were defined in the child class. A child class can also override data members and methods from the parent.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Derived classes are declared much like their parent class; however, a list of base classes to inherit from is given after the class name &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
class SubClassName (ParentClass1[, ParentClass2, ...]):
   'Optional class documentation string'
   class_suite
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Overriding Methods</h2>
<p>You can always override your parent class methods. One reason for overriding parent's methods is that you may want special or different functionality in your subclass.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Parent:        # define parent class
   def myMethod(self):
      print ('Calling parent method')

class Child(Parent): # define child class
   def myMethod(self):
      print ('Calling child method')

c = Child()          # instance of child
c.myMethod()         # child calls overridden method
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Calling child method
</pre>
<h2>Base Overloading Methods</h2>
<p>The following table lists some generic functionality that you can override in your own classes &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th><th style="text-align:center;">Method, Description &amp; Sample Call</th>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1</td><td><p><b>__init__ ( self [,args...] )</b></p>
<p>Constructor (with any optional arguments)</p>
<p>Sample Call : <i>obj = className(args)</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2</td><td><p><b>__del__( self )</b></p>
<p>Destructor, deletes an object</p>
<p>Sample Call : <i>del obj</i></p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3</td><td>
<p><b>__repr__( self )</b></p>

<p>Object comparison</p> 
<p>Sample Call : <i>cmp(obj, x)</i></p></td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Overloading Operators</h2>
<p>Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors. What happens when you use the plus operator to add them? Most likely Python will yell at you.</p>
<p>You could, however, define the <i>__add__</i> method in your class to perform vector addition and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class Vector:
   def __init__(self, a, b):
      self.a = a
      self.b = b

   def __str__(self):
      return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)
   
   def __add__(self,other):
      return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector(2,10)
v2 = Vector(5,-2)
print (v1 + v2)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Vector(7,8)
</pre>
<h2>Data Hiding</h2>
<p>An object's attributes may or may not be visible outside the class definition. You need to name attributes with a double underscore prefix, and those attributes then will not be directly visible to outsiders.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

class JustCounter:
   __secretCount = 0
  
   def count(self):
      self.__secretCount += 1
      print (self.__secretCount)

counter = JustCounter()
counter.count()
counter.count()
print (counter.__secretCount)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
1
2
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 12, in &lt;module&gt;
      print counter.__secretCount
AttributeError: JustCounter instance has no attribute '__secretCount'
</pre>
<p>Python protects those members by internally changing the name to include the class name. You can access such attributes as <i>object._className__attrName</i>. If you would replace your last line as following, then it works for you &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
.........................
print (counter._JustCounter__secretCount)

<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - Regular Expressions</h1>
<p>A <i>regular expression</i> is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.</p>
<p>The module <b>re</b> provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The <b>re</b> module raises the exception <b>re.error</b> if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.</p>
<p>We would cover two important functions, which would be used to handle regular expressions. Nevertheless, a small thing first: There are various characters, which would have special meaning when they are used in regular expression. To avoid any confusion while dealing with regular expressions, we would use Raw Strings as <b>r'expression'</b>.</p>
<h3>Basic patterns that match single chars</h3>

<h2>Matching Versus Searching</h2>
<p>Python offers two different primitive operations based on regular expressions: <b>match</b> checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while <b>search</b> checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default).</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re

line = "Cats are smarter than dogs";

matchObj = re.match( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I)
if matchObj:
   print ("match --&gt; matchObj.group() : ", matchObj.group())
else:
   print ("No match!!")

searchObj = re.search( r'dogs', line, re.M|re.I)
if searchObj:
   print ("search --&gt; searchObj.group() : ", searchObj.group())
else:
   print ("Nothing found!!")
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
No match!!
search --&gt; matchObj.group() :  dogs
</pre>
<h2>Search and Replace</h2>
<p>One of the most important <b>re</b> methods that use regular expressions is <b>sub</b>.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
re.sub(pattern, repl, string, max=0)
</pre>
<p>This method replaces all occurrences of the RE <i>pattern</i> in <i>string</i> with <i>repl</i>, substituting all occurrences unless <i>max</i> is provided. This method returns modified string.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import re

phone = "2004-959-559 # This is Phone Number"

# Delete Python-style comments
num = re.sub(r'#.*$', "", phone)
print ("Phone Num : ", num)

# Remove anything other than digits
num = re.sub(r'\D', "", phone)    
print ("Phone Num : ", num)
</pre>
<p>When the above code is  executed, it produces the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Phone Num :  2004-959-559
Phone Num :  2004959559
</pre>
<h2>Regular Expression Modifiers: Option Flags</h2>
<p>Regular expression literals may include an optional modifier to control various aspects of matching. The modifiers are specified as an optional flag. You can provide multiple modifiers using exclusive OR (|), as shown previously and may be represented by one of these &minus;</p>

<h1>Python 3 - CGI Programming</h1>
<p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a set of standards that define how information is exchanged between the web server and a custom script. The CGI specs are currently maintained by the NCSA and NCSA.</p>
<h2>What is CGI?</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The Common Gateway Interface, or CGI, is a standard for external gateway programs to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers.</p></li>
<li><p>The current version is CGI/1.1 and CGI/1.2 is under progress.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Web Browsing</h2>
<p>To understand the concept of CGI, let us see what happens when we click a hyper link to browse a particular web page or URL.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Your browser contacts the HTTP web server and demands for the URL, i.e., filename.</p></li>
<li><p>Web Server parses the URL and looks for the filename. If it finds that file then sends it back to the browser, otherwise sends an error message indicating that you requested a wrong file.</p></li>
<li><p>Web browser takes response from web server and displays either the received file or error message.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is possible to set up the HTTP server so that whenever a file in a certain directory is requested that file is not sent back; instead it is executed as a program, and whatever that program outputs is sent back for your browser to display. This function is called the Common Gateway Interface or CGI and the programs are called CGI scripts. These CGI programs can be a Python Script, PERL Script, Shell Script, C or C++ program, etc.</p>
<h2>CGI Architecture Diagram</h2>
<img src="/python3/images/cgiarch.gif" alt="CGI Architecture" />
<h2>Web Server Support and Configuration</h2>
<p class="alignment">Before you proceed with CGI Programming, make sure that your Web Server supports CGI and it is configured to handle CGI Programs. All the CGI Programs to be executed by the HTTP server are kept in a pre-configured directory. This directory is called CGI Directory and by convention it is named as /var/www/cgi-bin. By convention, CGI files have extension as.<b>cgi,</b> but you can keep your files with python extension <b>.py</b> as well.</p>
<p>By default, the Linux server is configured to run only the scripts in the cgi-bin directory in /var/www. If you want to specify any other directory to run your CGI scripts, comment the following lines in the httpd.conf file &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin"&gt;
   AllowOverride None
   Options ExecCGI
   Order allow,deny
   Allow from all
&lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin"&gt;
Options All
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
<p>Following line should also be added for apache server to treat .py file as cgi script</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
AddHandler cgi-script .py
</pre>
<p>Here, we assume that you have Web Server up and running successfully and you are able to run any other CGI program like Perl or Shell, etc.</p>
<h2>First CGI Program</h2>
<p>Here is a simple link, which is linked to a CGI script called <a href="/cgi-bin/hello.py" target="_blank">hello.py</a>. This file is kept in /var/www/cgi-bin directory and it has following content. Before running your CGI program, make sure you have change mode of file using <b>chmod 755 hello.py</b> UNIX command to make file executable.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

print ("Content-type:text/html")
print()
print ("&lt;html&gt;")
print ('&lt;head&gt;')
print ('&lt;title&gt;Hello Word - First CGI Program&lt;/title&gt;')
print ('&lt;/head&gt;')
print ('&lt;body&gt;')
print ('&lt;h2&gt;Hello Word! This is my first CGI program&lt;/h2&gt;')
print ('&lt;/body&gt;')
print ('&lt;/html&gt;')
</pre>
<p><b>Note:</b>First line in the script must be path to Python executable. In Linux it should be #!/usr/bin/python3</p>

<p>Enter following URL in yor browser</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
<a href="http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/hello.py">http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/hello.py</a>
</pre>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><td>
<h2>Hello Word! This is my first CGI program</h2>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>This hello.py script is a simple Python script, which writes its output on STDOUT file, i.e., screen. There is one important and extra feature available which is first line to be printed <b>Content-type:text/html</b> followed by a blank line. This line is sent back to the browser and it specifies the content type to be displayed on the browser screen.</p>
<p>By now you must have understood basic concept of CGI and you can write many complicated CGI programs using Python. This script can interact with any other external system also to exchange information such as RDBMS.</p>
<h2>HTTP Header</h2>
<p>The line <b>Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b> is part of HTTP header which is sent to the browser to understand the content. All the HTTP header will be in the following form &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP Field Name: Field Content

For Example
Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n
</pre>
<p>There are few other important HTTP headers, which you will use frequently in your CGI Programming.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<h2>CGI Environment Variables</h2>
<p>All the CGI programs have access to the following environment variables. These variables play an important role while writing any CGI program.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:30%;">Variable Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr> <td>CONTENT_TYPE</td><td>The data type of the content. Used when the client is sending attached content to the server. For example, file upload.</td> </tr>

</pre>
<h2>GET and POST Methods</h2>
<p>You must have come across many situations when you need to pass some information from your browser to web server and ultimately to your CGI Program. Most frequently, browser uses two methods two pass this information to web server. These methods are GET Method and POST Method.</p>
<h2>Passing Information using GET method</h2>
<p>The GET method sends the encoded user information appended to the page request. The page and the encoded information are separated by the ? character as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
http://www.test.com/cgi-bin/hello.py?key1=value1&amp;key2=value2
</pre>
<p>The GET method is the default method to pass information from browser to web server and it produces a long string that appears in your browser's Location:box. Never use GET method if you have password or other sensitive information to pass to the server. The GET method has size limtation: only 1024 characters can be sent in a request string. The GET method sends information using QUERY_STRING header and will be accessible in your CGI Program through QUERY_STRING environment variable.</p>
<p>You can pass information by simply concatenating key and value pairs along with any URL or you can use HTML &lt;FORM&gt; tags to pass information using GET method.</p>
<h2>Simple URL Example:Get Method</h2>
<p>Here is a simple URL, which passes two values to hello_get.py program using GET method.</p>
<a style="text-decoration:none;" href="/cgi-bin/hello_get.py?first_name=Malhar&amp;last_name=Lathkar" target="_blank">/cgi-bin/hello_get.py?first_name=Malhar&amp;last_name=Lathkar</a>
<p>Below is <b>hello_get.py</b> script to handle input given by web browser. We are going to use <b>cgi</b> module, which makes it very easy to access passed information &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import modules for CGI handling 
import cgi, cgitb 

# Create instance of FieldStorage 
form = cgi.FieldStorage() 

# Get data from fields
first_name = form.getvalue('first_name')
last_name  = form.getvalue('last_name')

print ("Content-type:text/html")
print()
print ("&lt;html&gt;)"
print ("&lt;head&gt;")
print ("&lt;title&gt;Hello - Second CGI Program&lt;/title&gt;")
print ("&lt;/head&gt;")
print ("&lt;body&gt;")
print ("&lt;h2&gt;Hello %s %s&lt;/h2&gt;" % (first_name, last_name))
print ("&lt;/body&gt;")
print ("&lt;/html&gt;"&gt;)
</pre>
<p>This would generate the following result:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><td>
<h2>Hello ZARA ALI</h2>
</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Simple FORM Example:GET Method</h2>
<p>This example passes two values using HTML FORM and submit button. We use same
CGI script hello_get.py to handle this input.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;form action="/cgi-bin/hello_get.py" method="get"&gt;
First Name: &lt;input type="text" name="first_name"&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

Last Name: &lt;input type="text" name="last_name" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here is the actual output of the above form, you enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>
<form action="/cgi-bin/hello_get.py" method="get" target="_blank">
First Name: <input type="text" name="first_name" /><br/>

Last Name: <input type="text" name="last_name" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" /></form>
<h2>Passing Information Using POST Method</h2>
<p>A generally more reliable method  of passing information to a CGI program is the POST method. This packages the information in exactly the same way as GET methods, but instead of sending it as a text string after a ? in the URL it sends it as a separate message. This message comes into the CGI script in the form of the standard input.</p>
<p>Below is same hello_get.py script which handles GET as well as POST method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import modules for CGI handling 
import cgi, cgitb 

# Create instance of FieldStorage 
form = cgi.FieldStorage() 

# Get data from fields
first_name = form.getvalue('first_name')
last_name  = form.getvalue('last_name')

print ("Content-type:text/html")
print()
print ("&lt;html&gt;")
print ("&lt;head&gt;")
print ("&lt;title&gt;Hello - Second CGI Program&lt;/title&gt;")
print ("&lt;/head&gt;")
print ("&lt;body&gt;")
print ("&lt;h2&gt;Hello %s %s&lt;/h2&gt;" % (first_name, last_name))
print ("&lt;/body&gt;")
print ("&lt;/html&gt;")
</pre>
<p>Let us take again same example as above which passes two values using HTML FORM and submit button. We use same CGI script hello_get.py to handle this input.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;form action="/cgi-bin/hello_get.py" method="post"&gt;
First Name: &lt;input type="text" name="first_name"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last Name: &lt;input type="text" name="last_name" /&gt;

&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p>Here is the actual output of the above form. You enter First and Last Name and then click submit button to see the result.</p>
<form action="/cgi-bin/hello_get.py" method="post" target="_blank">
First Name: <input type="text" name="first_name" /><br />

Last Name: <input type="text" name="last_name" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
<h2>Passing Checkbox Data to CGI Program</h2>
<p>Checkboxes are used when more than one option is required to be selected.</p>
<p>Here is example HTML code for a form with two checkboxes &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;form action="/cgi-bin/checkbox.py" method="POST" target="_blank"&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="maths" value="on" /&gt; Maths
&lt;input type="checkbox" name="physics" value="on" /&gt; Physics
&lt;input type="submit" value="Select Subject" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p>The result of this code is the above form:</p>
<form action="/cgi-bin/checkbox.py" method="post" target="_blank" >
<input type="checkbox" name="maths" value="on" /> Maths
<input type="checkbox" name="physics" value="on" /> Physics

<h2>Using Cookies in CGI</h2>
<p>HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol. For a commercial website, it is required to maintain session information  among different pages. For example, one user registration ends after completing many pages. How to maintain user's session information across all the web pages?</p>
<p>In many situations, using cookies is the most efficient method of remembering and tracking preferences, purchases, commissions, and other information required for better visitor experience or site statistics.</p>
<h2>How It Works?</h2>
<p>Your server sends some data to the visitor's browser in the form of a cookie. The browser may accept the cookie. If it does, it is stored as a plain text record on the visitor's hard drive. Now, when the visitor arrives at another page on your site, the cookie is available for retrieval. Once retrieved, your server knows/remembers what was stored.</p>
<p>Cookies are a plain text data record of 5 variable-length fields:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Expires:</b> The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Domain:</b> The domain name of your site.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Path:</b> The path to the directory or web page that sets the cookie. This may be blank if you want to retrieve the cookie from any directory or page.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Secure:</b> If this field contains the word "secure", then the cookie may only be retrieved with a secure server. If this field is blank, no such restriction exists.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Name=Value:</b> Cookies are set and retrieved in the form of key and value pairs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up Cookies</h2>
<p>It is very easy to send cookies to browser. These cookies are sent along with HTTP Header before to Content-type field. Assuming you want to set UserID and Password as cookies. Setting the cookies is done as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

print ("Set-Cookie:UserID=XYZ;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Password=XYZ123;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Expires=Tuesday, 31-Dec-2007 23:12:40 GMT";\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Domain=www.tutorialspoint.com;\r\n")
print ("Set-Cookie:Path=/perl;\n")
print ("Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n")
...........Rest of the HTML Content....
</pre>
<p>From this example, you must have understood how to set cookies. We use <b>Set-Cookie</b> HTTP header to set cookies.</p>
<p>It is optional to set cookies attributes like Expires, Domain, and Path. It is notable that cookies are set before sending magic line <b>"Content-type:text/html\r\n\r\n</b>.</p>
<h2>Retrieving Cookies</h2>
<p>It is very easy to retrieve all the set cookies. Cookies are stored in CGI environment variable HTTP_COOKIE and they will have following form &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
key1=value1;key2=value2;key3=value3....
</pre>
<p>Here is an example of how to retrieve cookies.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# Import modules for CGI handling 
from os import environ
import cgi, cgitb

if environ.has_key('HTTP_COOKIE'):
   for cookie in map(strip, split(environ['HTTP_COOKIE'], ';')):
      (key, value ) = split(cookie, '=');
      if key == "UserID":
         user_id = value

      if key == "Password":
         password = value

print ("User ID  = %s" % user_id)
print ("Password = %s" % password)
</pre>
<p>This produces the following result for the cookies set by above script &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
User ID = XYZ
Password = XYZ123
</pre>
<h2>File Upload Example</h2>
<p>To upload a file, the HTML form must have the enctype attribute set to <b>multipart/form-data</b>. The input tag with the file type creates a "Browse" button.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;form enctype="multipart/form-data" 
                     action="save_file.py" method="post"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;File: &lt;input type="file" name="filename" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Upload" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>The result of this code is the following form &minus;</p>
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="save_file.py" method="post">
   <p>File: <input type="file" name="filename" /></p>
   <p><input type="reset" value="Upload" /></p>
</form>
<p>Above example has been disabled intentionally to save people uploading file on our server, but you can try above code with your server.</p>
<p>Here is the script <b>save_file.py</b> to handle file upload &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import cgi, os
import cgitb; cgitb.enable()

form = cgi.FieldStorage()

# Get filename here.
fileitem = form['filename']

# Test if the file was uploaded
if fileitem.filename:
   # strip leading path from file name to avoid 
   # directory traversal attacks
   fn = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename)
   open('/tmp/' + fn, 'wb').write(fileitem.file.read())

   message = 'The file "' + fn + '" was uploaded successfully'
   
else:
   message = 'No file was uploaded'
   
print ("""\
Content-Type: text/html\n
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;%s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
""" % (message,))
</pre>
<p>If you run the above script on Unix/Linux, then you need to take care of replacing  file separator as follows, otherwise on your windows machine above open() statement should work fine.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fn = os.path.basename(fileitem.filename.replace("\\", "/" ))
</pre>

<h2>How To Raise a "File Download" Dialog Box ?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, it is desired that you want to give option where a user can click a link and it will pop up a "File Download" dialogue box to the user instead of displaying actual content. This is very easy and can be achieved through HTTP header. This HTTP header is be different from the header mentioned in previous section.</p>
<p>For example, if you want make a <b>FileName</b> file downloadable from a given link, then its syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

# HTTP Header
print ("<b>Content-Type:</b>application/octet-stream; name=\"FileName\"\r\n")
print ("<b>Content-Disposition:</b> attachment; filename=\"FileName\"\r\n\n")

# Actual File Content will go hear.
fo = open("foo.txt", "rb")

str = fo.read()
print str

# Close opened file
fo.close()

<h1>Python 3 - MySQL Database Access</h1>
<p>The Python standard for database interfaces is the Python DB-API. Most Python database interfaces adhere to this standard.</p>
<p>You can choose the right database for your application. Python Database API supports a wide range of database servers such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>GadFly</li>
<li>mSQL</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>Microsoft SQL Server 2000</li>
<li>Informix</li>
<li>Interbase</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>Sybase</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the list of available Python database interfaces &minus; <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Python Database Interfaces and APIs</a>. You must download a separate DB API module for each database you need to access. For example, if you need to access an Oracle database as well as a MySQL database, you must download both the Oracle and the MySQL database modules.</p>
<p>The DB API provides a minimal standard for working with databases using Python structures and syntax wherever possible. This API includes the following:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Importing the API module.</li>
<li>Acquiring a connection with the database.</li>
<li>Issuing SQL statements and stored procedures.</li>
<li>Closing the connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Python has an in-built support for SQLite. In this section, we would learn all the concepts using MySQL. MySQLdb module, a popular interface with MySQL is not compatible with Python 3. Instead, we shall use <a href="http://www.pymysql.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PyMySQL</a> module.</p>
<h2>What is PyMySQL ?</h2>
<p>PyMySQL is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server from Python. It implements the Python Database API v2.0 and contains a pure-Python MySQL client library. The goal of PyMySQL is to be a drop-in replacement for MySQLdb .</p>
<h2>How do I Install PyMySQL?</h2>
<p>Before proceeding furthur, you make sure you have PyMySQL installed on your machine. Just type the following in your Python script and execute it &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL
</pre>
<p>If it produces the following result, then it means MySQLdb module is not installed:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 3, in &lt;module&gt;
      Import PyMySQL
ImportError: No module named PyMySQL
</pre>
<p>The last stable release is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
pip install PyMySQL
</pre>
<p>Alternatively (e.g. if pip is not available), a tarball can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and installed with Setuptools as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ # X.X is the desired PyMySQL version (e.g. 0.5 or 0.6).
$ curl -L https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/tarball/pymysql-X.X | tar xz
$ cd PyMySQL*
$ python setup.py install
$ # The folder PyMySQL* can be safely removed now.
</pre>
<p><b>Note</b> &minus; Make sure you have root privilege to install the above module.</p>
<h2>Database Connection</h2>
<p>Before connecting to a MySQL database, make sure of the following points &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p></li>
<li><p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p></li>
<li><p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p></li>
<li><p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p></li>
<li><p>Python module PyMySQL is installed properly on your machine.</p></li>
<li><p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial to understand <a href="/mysql/index.htm">MySQL Basics.</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example of connecting with MySQL database "TESTDB" &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# execute SQL query using <i>execute()</i> method.
cursor.execute("SELECT VERSION()")

# Fetch a single row using <i>fetchone()</i> method.
data = cursor.fetchone()

print ("Database version : %s " % data)

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<p>While running this script, it produces the following result.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Database version : 5.5.20-log
</pre>
<p>If a connection is established with the datasource, then a Connection Object is returned and saved into <b>db</b> for further use, otherwise <b>db</b> is set to None. Next, <b>db</b> object is used to create a <b>cursor</b> object, which in turn is used to execute SQL queries. Finally, before coming out, it ensures that the database connection is closed and resources are released.</p>
<h2>Creating Database Table</h2>
<p>Once a database connection is established, we are ready to create tables or records into the database tables using <b>execute</b> method of the created cursor.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us create a Database table EMPLOYEE &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Drop table if it already exist using <i>execute()</i> method.
cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS EMPLOYEE")

# Create table as per requirement
sql = """CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
   FIRST_NAME  CHAR(20) NOT NULL,
   LAST_NAME  CHAR(20),
   AGE INT,  
   SEX CHAR(1),
   INCOME FLOAT )"""

cursor.execute(sql)

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h2>INSERT Operation</h2>
<p>The INSERT Operation is required when you want to create your records into a database table.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example, executes SQL <i>INSERT</i> statement to create a record in the EMPLOYEE table &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to INSERT a record into the database.
sql = """INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(FIRST_NAME,
   LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX, INCOME)
   VALUES ('Mac', 'Mohan', 20, 'M', 2000)"""
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<p>The above example can be written as follows to create SQL queries dynamically &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to INSERT a record into the database.
sql = "INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE(FIRST_NAME, \
   LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX, INCOME) \
   VALUES ('%s', '%s', '%d', '%c', '%d' )" % \
   ('Mac', 'Mohan', 20, 'M', 2000)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following code segment is another form of execution where you can pass parameters directly &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
..................................
user_id = "test123"
password = "password"

con.execute('insert into Login values("%s", "%s")' % \
             (user_id, password))
..................................
</pre>
<h2>READ Operation</h2>
<p>READ Operation on any database means to fetch some useful information from the database.</p>
<p>Once the database connection is established, you are ready to make a query into this database. You can use either <b>fetchone()</b> method to fetch a single record or <b>fetchall()</b> method to fetch multiple values from a database table.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>fetchone()</b> &minus; It fetches the next row of a query result set. A result set is an object that is returned when a cursor object is used to query a table.</p></li>
<li><p><b>fetchall()</b> &minus; It fetches all the rows in a result set. If some rows have already been extracted from the result set, then it retrieves
the remaining rows from the result set.</p></li>
<li><p><b>rowcount</b> &minus; This is a read-only attribute and returns the number of rows that were affected by an execute() method.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following procedure queries all the records from EMPLOYEE table having salary more than 1000 &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to INSERT a record into the database.
sql = "SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE \
       WHERE INCOME &gt; '%d'" % (1000)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Fetch all the rows in a list of lists.
   results = cursor.fetchall()
   for row in results:
      fname = row[0]
      lname = row[1]
      age = row[2]
      sex = row[3]
      income = row[4]
      # Now print fetched result
      print ("fname = %s,lname = %s,age = %d,sex = %s,income = %d" % \
             (fname, lname, age, sex, income ))
except:
   print ("Error: unable to fetch data")

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>This will produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
fname = Mac, lname = Mohan, age = 20, sex = M, income = 2000
</pre>
<h2>Update Operation</h2>
<p>UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>
<p>The following procedure updates all the records having SEX as <b>'M'</b>. Here, we increase the AGE of all the males by one year.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to UPDATE required records
sql = "UPDATE EMPLOYEE SET AGE = AGE + 1
                          WHERE SEX = '%c'" % ('M')
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h2>DELETE Operation</h2>
<p>DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database. Following is the  procedure to delete all the records from EMPLOYEE where AGE is more than 20 &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import PyMySQL

# Open database connection
db = PyMySQL.connect("localhost","testuser","test123","TESTDB" )

# prepare a cursor object using <i>cursor()</i> method
cursor = db.cursor()

# Prepare SQL query to DELETE required records
sql = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; '%d'" % (20)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()

# disconnect from server
db.close()
</pre>
<h2>Performing Transactions</h2>
<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Python DB API 2.0 provides two methods to either <i>commit</i> or <i>rollback</i> a transaction.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>You already know how to implement transactions. Here is a similar example &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Prepare SQL query to DELETE required records
sql = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; '%d'" % (20)
try:
   # Execute the SQL command
   cursor.execute(sql)
   # Commit your changes in the database
   db.commit()
except:
   # Rollback in case there is any error
   db.rollback()
</pre>
<h2>COMMIT Operation</h2>
<p>Commit is an operation, which gives a green signal to the database to finalize the changes, and after this operation, no change can be reverted back.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>commit</b> method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.commit()
</pre> 
<h2>ROLLBACK Operation</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>
<p>Here is a simple example to call the <b>rollback()</b> method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.rollback()
</pre>
<h2>Disconnecting Database</h2>
<p>To disconnect the Database connection, use the close() method.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
db.close()
</pre>
<p>If the connection to a database is closed by the user with the close() method, any outstanding transactions are rolled back by the DB. However, instead of depending on any of the DB lower level implementation details, your application would be better off calling commit or rollback explicitly.</p>
<h2>Handling Errors</h2>
<p>There are many sources of errors. A few examples are a syntax error in an executed SQL statement, a connection failure, or calling the fetch method for an already canceled or finished statement handle.</p>
<p>The DB API defines a number of errors that must exist in each database module. The following table lists these exceptions.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th><th>Exception &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">1</td><td><p><b>Warning</b></p><p>Used for non-fatal issues. Must subclass StandardError.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">2</td><td><p><b>Error</b></p><p>Base class for errors. Must subclass StandardError.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">3</td><td><p><b>InterfaceError</b></p><p>Used for errors in the database module, not the database itself. Must subclass Error.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">5</td><td><p><b>DataError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors in the data.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">6</td><td><p><b>OperationalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as the loss of a connection to the database. These errors are generally outside of the control of the Python scripter.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">7</td><td><p><b>IntegrityError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError for situations that would damage the relational integrity, such as uniqueness constraints or foreign keys.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">8</td><td><p><b>InternalError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors internal to the database module, such as a cursor no longer being active.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">9</td><td><p><b>ProgrammingError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to errors such as a bad table name and other things that can safely be blamed on you.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">10</td><td><p><b>NotSupportedError</b></p><p>Subclass of DatabaseError that refers to trying to call unsupported functionality.</p></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Your Python scripts should handle these errors, but before using any of the above exceptions, make sure your MySQLdb has support for that exception. You can get more information about them by reading the DB API 2.0 specification.</p>
<h1>Python 3 - Network Programming</h1>
<p>Python provides two levels of access to the network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.</p>
<p>Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.</p>
<p>This chapter gives you an understanding on the most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.</p>
<h2>What is Sockets?</h2>
<p>Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.</p>
<p>Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The <i>socket</i> library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.</p>
<p>Sockets have their own vocabulary &minus;</p>

<h2>The socket Module</h2>
<p>To create a socket, you must use the <i>socket.socket()</i> function available in the socket module, which has the general syntax &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
s = socket.socket (socket_family, socket_type, protocol = 0)

<h2>A Simple Server</h2>
<p>To write Internet servers, we use the <b>socket</b> function available in socket module to create a socket object. A socket object is then used to call other functions to setup a socket server.</p>
<p>Now call the <b>bind(hostname, port)</b> function to specify a <i>port</i> for your service on the given host.</p>
<p>Next, call the <i>accept</i> method of the returned object. This method waits until a client connects to the port you specified, and then returns a <i>connection</i> object that represents the connection to that client.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3           # This is server.py file
import socket                                         

# create a socket object
serversocket = socket.socket(
	        socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 

# get local machine name
host = socket.gethostname()                           

port = 9999                                           

# bind to the port
serversocket.bind((host, port))                                  

# queue up to 5 requests
serversocket.listen(5)                                           

while True:
    # establish a connection
    clientsocket,addr = serversocket.accept()      

    print("Got a connection from %s" % str(addr))
    
    msg='Thank you for connecting'+ "\r\n"
    clientsocket.send(msg.encode('ascii'))
    clientsocket.close()
</pre>
<h2>A Simple Client</h2>
<p>Let us write a very simple client program which opens a connection to a given port 12345 and a given host. It is very simple to create a socket client using the Python's <i>socket</i> module function.</p>
<p>The <b>socket.connect(hosname, port )</b> opens a TCP connection to <i>hostname</i> on the <i>port</i>. Once you have a socket open, you can read from it like any IO object. When done, remember to close it, as you would close a file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following code is a very simple client that connects to a given host and port, reads any available data from the socket, and then exits &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3           # This is client.py file

import socket

# create a socket object
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 

# get local machine name
host = socket.gethostname()                           

port = 9999

# connection to hostname on the port.
s.connect((host, port))                               

# Receive no more than 1024 bytes
msg = s.recv(1024)                                     

s.close()

print (msg.decode('ascii'))
</pre>
<p>Now run this server.py in the background and then run the above client.py to see the result.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
# Following would start a server in background.
$ python server.py &amp; 

# Once server is started run client as follows:

$ python client.py
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>This would produce following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>Python 3 - Sending Email using SMTP</h1>
<p>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending an e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. </p>
<p>Python provides <b>smtplib</b> module, which defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mails to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.</p>
<p>Here is a simple syntax to create one SMTP object, which can later be used to send an e-mail &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
import smtplib

smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP( [host [, port [, local_hostname]]] )
</pre>
<p>Here is the detail of the parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>host</b> &minus; This is the host running your SMTP server. You can specifiy IP address of the host or a domain name like tutorialspoint.com. This is an optional argument.</p></li>
<li><p><b>port</b> &minus; If you are providing <i>host</i> argument, then you need to specify a port, where SMTP server is listening. Usually this port would be 25.</p></li>
<li><p><b>local_hostname</b> &minus; If your SMTP server is running on your local machine, then you can specify just <i>localhost</i> the option.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An SMTP object has an instance method called <b>sendmail</b>, which is typically used to do the work of mailing a message. It takes three parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <i>sender</i> &minus; A string with the address of the sender.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>receivers</i> &minus; A list of strings, one for each recipient.</p></li>
<li><p>The <i>message</i> &minus; A message as a string formatted as specified in the various RFCs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here is a simple way to send one e-mail using Python script. Try it once &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import smtplib

sender = 'from@fromdomain.com'
receivers = ['to@todomain.com']

message = """From: From Person &lt;from@fromdomain.com&gt;
To: To Person &lt;to@todomain.com&gt;
Subject: SMTP e-mail test

This is a test e-mail message.
"""

try:
   smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
   smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, message)         
   print "Successfully sent email"
except SMTPException:
   print "Error: unable to send email"
</pre>
<p>Here, you have placed a basic e-mail in message, using a triple quote, taking care to format the headers correctly. An e-mail requires a <b>From</b>, <b>To</b>, and a <b>Subject</b> header, separated from the body of the e-mail with a blank line.</p>
<p>To send the mail you use <i>smtpObj</i> to connect to the SMTP server on the local machine. Then use the <i>sendmail</i> method along with the message, the from address, and the destination address as parameters (even though the from and to addresses are within the e-mail itself, these are not always used to route the mail).</p>
<p>If you are not running an SMTP server on your local machine, you can the use <i>smtplib</i> client to communicate with a remote SMTP server. Unless you are using a webmail service (such as gmail or Yahoo! Mail), your e-mail provider must have provided you with the outgoing mail server details that you can supply them, as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
mail = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
</pre>
<h2>Sending an HTML e-mail using Python</h2>
<p>When you send a text message using Python, then all the content is treated as simple text. Even if you include HTML tags in a text message, it is displayed as simple text and HTML tags will not be formatted according to the HTML syntax. However, Python provides an option to send an HTML message as actual HTML message.</p>
<p>While sending an e-mail message, you can specify a Mime version, content type  and the character set to send an HTML e-mail.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example to send the HTML content as an e-mail. Try it once &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import smtplib

message = """From: From Person &lt;from@fromdomain.com&gt;
To: To Person &lt;to@todomain.com&gt;
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Subject: SMTP HTML e-mail test

This is an e-mail message to be sent in HTML format

&lt;b&gt;This is HTML message.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is headline.&lt;/h1&gt;
"""

try:
   smtpObj = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
   smtpObj.sendmail(sender, receivers, message)         
   print "Successfully sent email"
except SMTPException:
   print "Error: unable to send email"
</pre>
<h2>Sending Attachments as an E-mail</h2>
<p>To send an e-mail with mixed content requires setting the <b>Content-type</b> header to <b>multipart/mixed</b>. Then, the text and the attachment sections can be specified within <b>boundaries</b>.</p>
<p>A boundary is started with two hyphens followed by a unique number, which cannot appear in the message part of the e-mail. A final boundary denoting the e-mail's final section must also end with two hyphens.</p>
<p>The attached files should be encoded with the <b>pack("m")</b> function to have base 64 encoding before transmission.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following is an example, which sends  a file <b>/tmp/test.txt</b> as an attachment. Try it once &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import smtplib

<h1>Python 3 - Multithreaded Programming</h1>
<p>Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Threads are sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they are cheaper than processes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context is it currently running.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>It can be pre-empted (interrupted).</p></li>
<li><p>It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are two different kind of threads &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>kernel thread</li>
<li>user thread</li>
</ul>
<p>Kernel Threads are a part of the operating system, while the User-space threads are not implemented in the kernel. </p>
<p>There are two modules which support the usage of threads in Python3 &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>_thread</li>
<li>threading</li>
</ul>
<p>The thread module has been "deprecated" for quite a long time. Users are encouraged to use the threading module instead. Hence, in Python 3, the module "thread" is not available anymore. However, it has been renamed to "_thread" for backwards compatibilities in Python3. </p>
<h2>Starting a New Thread</h2>
<p>To spawn another thread, you need to call the following method available in the <i>thread</i> module &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
_thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )
</pre>
<p>This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of <i>args</i>. When the function returns, the thread terminates.</p>
<p>Here, <i>args</i> is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. <i>kwargs </i>is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import _thread
import time

# Define a function for the thread
def print_time( threadName, delay):
   count = 0
   while count &lt; 5:
      time.sleep(delay)
      count += 1
      print ("%s: %s" % ( threadName, time.ctime(time.time()) ))

# Create two threads as follows
try:
   _thread.start_new_thread( print_time, ("Thread-1", 2, ) )
   _thread.start_new_thread( print_time, ("Thread-2", 4, ) )
except:
   print ("Error: unable to start thread")

<h2>The Threading Module</h2>
<p>The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.</p>
<p>The <i>threading</i> module exposes all the methods of the <i>thread</i> module and provides some additional methods &minus;</p>

<li><p><b>threading.enumerate()</b> &minus; Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the methods, the threading module has the <i>Thread</i> class that implements threading. The methods provided by the <i>Thread</i> class are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>run()</b> &minus; The run() method is the entry point for a thread.</p></li>
<li><p><b>start()</b> &minus; The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.</p></li>
<li><p><b> join([time])</b> &minus; The join() waits for threads to terminate.</p></li>
<li><p><b> isAlive()</b> &minus; The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.</p></li>
<li><p><b> getName()</b> &minus; The getName() method returns the name of a thread.</p></li>
<li><p><b> setName()</b> &minus; The setName() method sets the name of a thread.</p></li>

<li><p>Define a new subclass of the <i>Thread</i> class.</p></li>
<li><p>Override the <i>__init__(self [,args])</i> method to add additional arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have created the new <i>Thread</i> subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the <i>start()</i>, which in turn calls the <i>run()</i> method.</p>

<h2>Synchronizing Threads</h2>
<p>The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the <i>Lock()</i> method, which returns the new lock.</p>
<p>The <i>acquire(blocking)</i> method of the new lock object is used to force the threads to run synchronously. The optional <i>blocking</i> parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.</p>
<p>If <i>blocking</i> is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.</p>
<p>The <i>release()</i> method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">

<h1>Python 3 - XML Processing</h1>
<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of operating system and/or developmental language.</p>
<h2>What is XML?</h2>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard.</p>
<p>XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring an SQL-based backbone.</p>
<h2>XML Parser Architectures and APIs</h2>
<p>The Python standard library provides a minimal but useful set of interfaces to work with XML.</p>
<p>The two most basic and broadly used APIs to XML data are the SAX and DOM interfaces.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Simple API for XML (SAX)</b> &minus; Here, you register callbacks for events of interest and then let the parser proceed through the document. This is useful when your documents are large or you have memory limitations, it parses the file as it reads it from the disk and the entire file is never stored in the memory.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Document Object Model (DOM) API</b> &minus; This is a World Wide Web Consortium recommendation wherein the entire file is read into the memory and stored in a hierarchical (tree-based) form to represent all the features of an XML document.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SAX obviously cannot process information as fast as DOM, when working with large files. On the other hand, using DOM exclusively can really kill your resources, especially if used on many small files.</p>
<p>SAX is read-only, while DOM allows changes to the XML file. Since these two different APIs literally complement each other, there is no reason why you cannot use them both for large projects.</p>
<p>For all our XML code examples, let us use a simple XML file <i>movies.xml</i> as an input &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate" id="movies_xml">

<h2>Parsing XML with SAX APIs</h2>
<p>SAX is a standard interface for event-driven XML parsing. Parsing XML with SAX generally requires you to create your own ContentHandler by subclassing xml.sax.ContentHandler.</p>
<p>Your <i>ContentHandler</i> handles the particular tags and attributes of your flavor(s) of XML. A ContentHandler object provides methods to handle various parsing events. Its owning parser calls ContentHandler methods as it parses the XML file.</p>
<p>The methods <i>startDocument</i> and <i>endDocument</i> are called at the start and the end of the XML file. The method <i>characters(text)</i> is passed the character data of the XML file via the parameter text.</p>
<p>The ContentHandler is called at the start and end of each element. If the parser is not in namespace mode, the methods <i>startElement(tag, attributes)</i> and <i>endElement(tag)</i> are called; otherwise, the corresponding methods <i>startElementNS</i> and <i>endElementNS</i> are called. Here, tag is the element tag, and attributes is an Attributes object.</p>
<p>Here are other important methods to understand before proceeding &minus;</p>
<h2>The make_parser Method</h2>
<p>The following method creates a new parser object and returns it. The parser object created will be of the first parser type, the system finds.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
xml.sax.make_parser( [parser_list] )
</pre>
<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>parser_list</b> &minus; The optional argument consisting of a list of parsers to use which must all implement the make_parser method.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The parse Method</h2>
<p>The following method creates a SAX parser and uses it to parse a document.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
xml.sax.parse( xmlfile, contenthandler[, errorhandler])
</pre>
<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>xmlfile</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML file to read from.</p></li>
<li><p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p></li>
<li><p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The parseString Method</h2>
<p>There is one more method to create a SAX parser and to parse the specified <b>XML string</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
xml.sax.parseString(xmlstring, contenthandler[, errorhandler])
</pre>
<p>Here are the details of the parameters &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>xmlstring</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML string to read from.</p></li>
<li><p><b>contenthandler</b> &minus; This must be a ContentHandler object.</p></li>
<li><p><b>errorhandler</b> &minus; If specified, errorhandler must be a SAX ErrorHandler object.</p></li>

<h2>Parsing XML with DOM APIs</h2>
<p>The Document Object Model ("DOM") is a cross-language API from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying the XML documents.</p>
<p>The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications. SAX only allows you a view of one bit of the document at a time. If you are looking at one SAX element, you have no access to another.</p>
<p>Here is the easiest way to load an XML document quickly and to create a minidom object using the xml.dom module. The minidom object provides a simple parser method that quickly creates a DOM tree from the XML file.</p>
<p>The sample phrase calls the parse( file [,parser] ) function of the minidom object to parse the XML file, designated by file into a DOM tree object.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
#!/usr/bin/python3

from xml.dom.minidom import parse
import xml.dom.minidom

# Open XML document using minidom parser
DOMTree = xml.dom.minidom.parse("movies.xml")
collection = DOMTree.documentElement
if collection.hasAttribute("shelf"):
   print ("Root element : %s" % collection.getAttribute("shelf"))

# Get all the movies in the collection
movies = collection.getElementsByTagName("movie")

# Print detail of each movie.
for movie in movies:
   print ("*****Movie*****")
   if movie.hasAttribute("title"):
      print ("Title: %s" % movie.getAttribute("title"))

   type = movie.getElementsByTagName('type')[0]
   print ("Type: %s" % type.childNodes[0].data)
   format = movie.getElementsByTagName('format')[0]
   print ("Format: %s" % format.childNodes[0].data)
   rating = movie.getElementsByTagName('rating')[0]

</ul>
<h1>Python 3 - Extension Programming with C</h1>
<p>Any code that you write using any compiled language like C, C&plus;&plus;, or Java can be integrated or imported into another Python script. This code is considered as an "extension."</p>
<p>A Python extension module is nothing more than a normal C library. On Unix machines, these libraries usually end in <b>.so</b> (for shared object). On Windows machines, you typically see <b>.dll</b> (for dynamically linked library).</p>
<h2>Pre-Requisites for Writing Extensions</h2>
<p>To start writing your extension, you are going to need the Python header files.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>On Unix machines, this usually requires installing a developer-specific package such as <a href="https://packages.debian.org/etch-m68k/python2.5-dev" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">python2.5-dev</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Windows users get these headers as part of the package when they use the binary Python installer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, it is assumed that you have a good knowledge of C or C&plus;&plus; to write any Python Extension using C programming.</p>
<h2>First look at a Python Extension</h2>
<p>For your first look at a Python extension module, you need to group your code into four part &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The header file <i>Python.h</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>The C functions you want to expose as the interface from your module.</p></li>
<li><p>A table mapping the names of your functions as Python developers see them as C functions inside the extension module.</p></li>
<li><p>An initialization function.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>The Header File Python.h</h2>
<p>You need to include <i>Python.h</i> header file in your C source file, which gives you the access to the internal Python API used to hook your module into the interpreter.</p>
<p>Make sure to include Python.h before any other headers you might need. You need to follow the includes with the functions you want to call from Python.</p>
<h2>The C Functions</h2>
<p>The signatures of the C implementation of your functions always takes one of the following three forms &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *MyFunction( PyObject *self, PyObject *args );

static PyObject *MyFunctionWithKeywords(PyObject *self,
                                 PyObject *args,
                                 PyObject *kw);

static PyObject *MyFunctionWithNoArgs( PyObject *self );
</pre>
<p>Each one of the preceding declarations returns a Python object. There is no such thing as a <i>void </i> function in Python as there is in C. If you do not want your functions to return a value, return the C equivalent of Python's <b>None</b> value. The Python headers define a macro, Py_RETURN_NONE, that does this for us.</p>
<p>The names of your C functions can be whatever you like as they are never seen outside of the extension module. They are defined as <i>static</i> function.</p>
<p>Your C functions usually are named by combining the Python module and function names together, as shown here &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   /* Do your stuff here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
</pre>
<p>This is a Python function called <i>func</i> inside the module <i>module</i>. You will be putting pointers to your C functions into the method table for the module that usually comes next in your source code.</p>
<h2>The Method Mapping Table</h2>
<p>This method table is a simple array of PyMethodDef structures. That structure looks something like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
struct PyMethodDef {
   char *ml_name;
   PyCFunction ml_meth;
   int ml_flags;
   char *ml_doc;
};
</pre>
<p>Here is the description of the members of this structure &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>ml_name</b> &minus; This is the name of the function as the Python interpreter presents when it is used in Python programs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ml_meth</b> &minus; This is the address of a function that has any one of the signatures described in the previous section.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ml_flags</b> &minus; This tells the interpreter which of the three signatures ml_meth is using.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>This flag usually has a value of METH_VARARGS.</p></li>
<li><p>This flag can be bitwise OR'ed with METH_KEYWORDS if you want to allow keyword arguments into your function.</p></li>
<li><p>This can also have a value of METH_NOARGS that indicates you do not want to accept any arguments.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>ml_doc</b> &minus; This is the docstring for the function, which could be NULL if you do not feel like writing one.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This table needs to be terminated with a sentinel that consists of NULL and 0 values for the appropriate members.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For the above-defined function, we have the following method mapping table &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyMethodDef module_methods[] = {
   { "func", (PyCFunction)module_func, METH_NOARGS, NULL },
   { NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};
</pre>
<h2>The Initialization Function</h2>
<p>The last part of your extension module is the initialization function. This function is called by the Python interpreter when the module is loaded. It is required that the function be named <b>init<i>Module</i></b>, where <i>Module</i> is the name of the module.</p>
<p>The initialization function needs to be exported from the library you will be building. The Python headers define PyMODINIT_FUNC to include the appropriate incantations for that to happen for the particular environment in which we are compiling. All you have to do is use it when defining the function.</p>
<p>Your C initialization function generally has the following overall structure &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
PyMODINIT_FUNC initModule() {
   Py_InitModule3(func, module_methods, "docstring...");
}
</pre>
<p>Here is the description of <b>Py_InitModule3</b> function &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>func</b> &minus; This is the function to be exported.</p></li>
<li><p><b>module_methods</b> &minus; This is the mapping table name defined above.</p></li>
<li><p><b>docstring</b> &minus; This is the comment you want to give in your extension.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Putting all this together, it looks like the following &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   /* Do your stuff here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}

static PyMethodDef module_methods[] = {
   { "func", (PyCFunction)module_func, METH_NOARGS, NULL },
   { NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC initModule() {
   Py_InitModule3(func, module_methods, "docstring...");
}
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>A simple example that makes use of all the above concepts &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

static PyObject* helloworld(PyObject* self)
{
    return Py_BuildValue("s", "Hello, Python extensions!!");
}

static char helloworld_docs[] =
    "helloworld( ): Any message you want to put here!!\n";

static PyMethodDef helloworld_funcs[] = {
    {"helloworld", (PyCFunction)helloworld, 
     METH_NOARGS, helloworld_docs},
    {NULL}
};

void inithelloworld(void)
{
    Py_InitModule3("helloworld", helloworld_funcs,
                   "Extension module example!");
}
</pre>
<p>Here the <i>Py_BuildValue</i> function is used to build a Python value. Save above code in hello.c file. We would see how to compile and install this module to be called from Python script.</p>
<h2>Building and Installing Extensions:</h2>
<p>The <i>distutils</i> package makes it very easy to distribute Python modules, both pure Python and extension modules, in a standard way. Modules are distributed in the source form, built and installed via a setup script usually called <i>setup.py</i> as.</p>
<p>For the above module, you need to prepare the following setup.py script &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
from distutils.core import setup, Extension
setup(name = 'helloworld', version = '1.0',  \
      ext_modules = [Extension('helloworld', ['hello.c'])])
</pre>
<p>Now, use the following command, which would perform all needed compilation and linking steps, with the right compiler and linker commands and flags, and copies the resulting dynamic library into an appropriate directory &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$ python setup.py install
</pre>
<p>On Unix-based systems, you will most likely need to run this command as root in order to have permissions to write to the site-packages directory. This usually is not a problem on Windows.</p>
<h2>Importing Extensions</h2>
<p>Once you install your extensions, you would be able to import and call that extension in your Python script as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3
import helloworld

print helloworld.helloworld()
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello, Python extensions!!
</pre>
<h2>Passing Function Parameters</h2>
<p>As you will most likely want to define functions that accept arguments, you can use one of the other signatures for your C functions. For example, the following function, that accepts some number of parameters, would be defined like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   /* Parse args and do something interesting here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
</pre>
<p>The method table containing an entry for the new function would look like this &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyMethodDef module_methods[] = {
   { "func", (PyCFunction)module_func, METH_NOARGS, NULL },
   { "func", module_func, METH_VARARGS, NULL },
   { NULL, NULL, 0, NULL }
};
</pre>
<p>You can use the API <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> function to extract the arguments from the one PyObject pointer passed into your C function.</p>
<p>The first argument to PyArg_ParseTuple is the args argument. This is the object you will be <i>parsing</i>. The second argument is a format string describing the arguments as you expect them to appear. Each argument is represented by one or more characters in the format string as follows.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *module_func(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int i;
   double d;
   char *s;

   if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ids", &amp;i, &amp;d, &amp;s)) {
      return NULL;
   }
   
   /* Do something interesting here. */
   Py_RETURN_NONE;
}
</pre>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Compiling the new version of your module and importing it enables you to invoke the new function with any number of arguments of any type &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
module.func(1, s = "three", d = 2.0)
module.func(i = 1, d = 2.0, s = "three")
module.func(s = "three", d = 2.0, i = 1)
</pre>
<p>You can probably come up with even more variations.</p>
<h2>The PyArg_ParseTuple Function</h2>
<p>Here is the standard signature for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
int PyArg_ParseTuple(PyObject* tuple,char* format,...)
</pre>
<p>This function returns 0 for errors, and a value not equal to 0 for success. Tuple is the PyObject* that was the C function's second argument. Here <i>format</i> is a C string that describes mandatory and optional arguments.</p>
<p>Here is a list of format codes for the <b>PyArg_ParseTuple</b> function &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

</table>
<h2>Returning Values</h2>
<p><i>Py_BuildValue</i> takes in a format string much like <i>PyArg_ParseTuple</i> does. Instead of passing in the addresses of the values you are building, you pass in the actual values. Here is an example showing how to implement an add function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *foo_add(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int a;
   int b;

   if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "ii", &amp;a, &amp;b)) {
      return NULL;
   }
   return Py_BuildValue("i", a + b);
}
</pre>
<p>This is what it would look like if implemented in Python &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
def add(a, b):
   return (a + b)
</pre>
<p>You can return two values from your function as follows. This would be captured using a list in Python.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
static PyObject *foo_add_subtract(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
   int a;

<h2>The <i>Py_BuildValue</i> Function:</h2>
<p>Here is the standard signature for <b>Py_BuildValue</b> function &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
PyObject* Py_BuildValue(char* format,...)
</pre>

<title>Python 3 Tools/Utilities</title>

<h1>Python 3 - Tools/Utilities</h1>

<p>The standard library comes with a number of modules that can be used both as modules and as command-line utilities.</p>

<h2>The <i>dis</i> Module:</h2>

<p>The dis module is the Python disassembler. It converts byte codes to a format that is slightly more appropriate for human consumption.</p>

<p>You can run the disassembler from the command line. It compiles the given script and prints the disassembled byte codes to the STDOUT. You can also use dis as a module. The <b>dis</b> function takes a class, method, function or code object as its single argument.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This would produce the following result &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>pdb</i> Module</h2>

<p>The pdb module is the standard Python debugger. It is based on the bdb debugger framework.</p>

<p>You can run the debugger from the command line (type n [or next] to go to the next line and help to get a list of available commands) &minus;</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Before you try to run <b>pdb.py</b>, set your path properly to Python lib directory. So let us try with above example sum.py &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>profile</i> Module</h2>

<p>The profile module is the standard Python profiler. You can run the profiler from the command line &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us try to profile the following program &minus;</p>

<p>Now, try running <b>cProfile.py</b> over this file <i>sum.py</i> as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>tabnanny</i> Module</h2>

<p>The tabnanny module checks Python source files for ambiguous indentation. If a file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that throws off indentation, no matter what tab size you're using, the nanny complains &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let us try to profile the following program &minus;</p>

<p>If you would try a correct file with tabnanny.py, then it won't complain as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>The <i>profile</i> Module</h2>
<p>The profile module is the standard Python profiler. You can run the profiler from the command line &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us try to profile the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

vara = 10
varb = 20

sum = vara + varb
print "vara + varb = %d" % sum
</pre>
<p>Now, try running <b>cProfile.py</b> over this file <i>sum.py</i> as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$cProfile.py sum.py
vara + varb = 30
         4 function calls in 0.000 CPU seconds

   Ordered by: standard name

</pre>
<h2>The <i>tabnanny</i> Module</h2>
<p>The tabnanny module checks Python source files for ambiguous indentation. If a file mixes tabs and spaces in a way that throws off indentation, no matter what tab size you're using, the nanny complains &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us try to profile the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python3

vara = 10
varb = 20

sum = vara + varb
print "vara + varb = %d" % sum
</pre>
<p>If you would try a correct file with tabnanny.py, then it won't complain as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
$tabnanny.py -v sum.py
'sum.py': Clean bill of health.

<title>Discuss Python 3</title>

<h1>Discuss Python 3</h1>

<p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Python is named after a TV Show called ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’ and not after Python-the snake. </p>

<p> Python 3.0 was released in 2008. Although this version is supposed to be backward incompatibles, later on many of its important features have been backported to be compatible with version 2.7.This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python 3 version programming language. Please refer to <a href="/python/index.htm" target="_blank">this link</a> for our Python 2 tutorial.</p>
