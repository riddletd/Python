<h1>Statistics - Adjusted R-Squared</h1>

<p>R-squared measures the proportion of the variation in your dependent variable (Y) explained by your independent variables (X) for a linear regression model. Adjusted R-squared adjusts the statistic based on the number of independent variables in the model.${R^2}$ shows how well terms (data points) fit a curve or line. Adjusted ${R^2}$ also indicates how well terms fit a curve or line, but adjusts for the number of terms in a model. If you add more and more useless variables to a model, adjusted r-squared will decrease. If you add more useful variables, adjusted r-squared will increase.</p>

<p>Adjusted ${R_{adj}^2}$ will always be less than or equal to ${R^2}$. You only need ${R^2}$ when working with samples. In other words, ${R^2}$ isn't necessary when you have data from an entire population.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${R_{adj}^2 = 1 - [\frac{(1-R^2)(n-1)}{n-k-1}]}$</p>

<p>Where &minus;</p>

<p>${n}$ = the number of points in your data sample.</p>

<p>${k}$ = the number of independent regressors, i.e. the number of variables in your model, excluding the constant.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A fund has a sample R-squared value close to 0.5 and it is doubtlessly offering higher risk adjusted returns with the sample size of 50 for 5 predictors. Find Adjusted R square value.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Sample size = 50 Number of predictor = 5 Sample R - square = 0.5.Substitute the qualities in the equation,</p>

<title>Statistics - Analysis of Variance</title>

<h1>Statistics - Analysis of Variance</h1>

<p>Analysis of Variance also termed as ANOVA. It is procedure followed by statisticans to check the potential difference between scale-level dependent variable by a nominal-level variable having two or more categories. It was developed by Ronald Fisher in 1918 and it extends t-test and z-test which compares only nominal level variable to have just two categories.</p>

<h2>Types of ANOVA</h2>

<p>ANOVAs are majorly of three types:</p>

<p><b>One-way ANOVA</b> - One-way ANOVA have only one independent variable and refers to numbers in this variable. For example, to assess differences in IQ by country, you can have 1, 2, and more countries data to compare.</p>

<p><b>Two-way ANOVA</b> - Two way ANOVA uses two independent variables. For example, to access differences in IQ by country (variable 1) and gender(variable 2). Here you can examine the interaction between two independent variables. Such Interactions may indicate that differences in IQ is not uniform across a independent variable. For examples females may have higher IQ score over males and have very high score over males in Europe than in America.</p>

<p>Two-way ANOVAs are also termed as factorial ANOVA and can be balanced as well as unbalanced. Balanced refers to having same number of participants in each group where as unbalanced refers to having different number of participants in each group. Following special kind of ANOVAs can be used to handle unbalanced groups.</p>

<p><b>Hierarchical approach(Type 1)</b> -If data was not intentionaly unbalanced and has some type of hierarchy between the factors.</p>

<p><b>Classical experimental approach(Type 2)</b> - If data was not intentionaly unbalanced and has no hierarchy between the factors.</p>

<p><b>Full Regression approach(Type 3)</b> - If data was intentionaly unbalanced because of population.</p>

<p><b>N-way or Multivariate ANOVA</b> - N-way ANOVA have multiple independent variables. For example, to assess differences in IQ by country, gender, age etc. simultaneously, N-way ANOVA is to be deployed.</p>

<h2>ANOVA Test Procedure</h2>

<p>Following are the general steps to carry out ANOVA.</p>

<p>Setup null and alternative hypothesis where null hypothesis states that there is no significant difference among the groups. And alternative hypothesis assumes that there is a significant difference among the groups.</p>

<p>Calculate F-ratio and probability of F.</p>

<p>Compare p-value of the F-ratio with the established alpha or significance level.</p>

<p>If p-value of F is less than 0.5 then reject the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>If null hypothesis is rejected, conclude that mean of groups are not equal.</p>

<title>Statistics - Black-Scholes model</title>

<h1>Statistics - Black-Scholes model</h1>

<p>The Black Scholes model is a mathematical model to check price variation over time of financial instruments such as stocks which can be used to compute the price of a European call option. This model assumes that the price of assets which are heavily traded follows a geometric Brownian motion having a constant drift and volatility. In case of stock option, Black Scholes model incorporates the constant price variation of the underlying stock, the time value of money, strike price of the option and its time to expiry.</p>

<p>The Black Scholes Model was developed in 1973 by Fisher Black, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes and is still widely used in euporian financial markets. It provides one of the best way to determine fair prices of options.</p>

<h2>Inputs</h2>

<p>The Black Scholes model requires five inputs.</p>

<p>Strike price of an option</p>

<p>Current stock price</p>

<p>Time to expiry</p>

<p>Risk-free rate</p>

<p>Volatility</p>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>

<p>The Black Scholes model assumes following points.</p>

<p>Stock prices follow a lognormal distribution.</p>

<p>Asset prices cannot be negative.</p>

<p>No transaction cost or tax.</p>

<p>Risk-free interest rate is constant for all maturities.</p>

<p>Short selling of securities with use of proceeds is permitted.</p>

<p>No riskless arbitrage opportunity present.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${C}$ = Value of Call Option.</p>

<p>${P}$ = Value of Put Option.</p>

<p>${S}$ = Stock Price.</p>

<p>${K}$ = Strike Price.</p>

<p>${r}$ = Risk free interest rate.</p>

<p>${T}$ = Time to maturity.</p>

<p>${\sigma}$ = Annualized volatility.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>The Black Scholes model have following limitations.</p>

<p>Only applicable to European options as American options could be exercised before their expiry.</p>

<p>Constant dividend and constant risk free rates may not be relistic.</p>

<p>Volatility may fluctuate with the level of supply and demand of option thus being constant may not be true.</p>

<title>Statistics - Boxplots</title>

<h1>Statistics - Boxplots</h1>

<p>The box plot is a standardized way to display the distribution of data based on following five number summary.</p>

<p>Minimum</p>

<p>First Quartile</p>

<p>Median</p>

<p>Third Quartile</p>

<p>Maximum</p>

<p>For a uniformly distributed data set,in box plot diagram, the central rectangle spans the first quartile to the third quartile (or the interquartile range, IQR). A line inside the rectangle shows the median and "whiskers" above and below the box show the locations of the minimum and maximum values. Such box plot displays the full range of variation from min to max, the likely range of variation, the IQR, and the median.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement:</h2>

<p>Create a box plot for the following two datasets.</p>

<h2>Solution:</h2>

<p>Here both datasets are uniformly balanced around zero so mean is around zero. In first data set variation ranges approximately from -2.5 to 2.5 whereas in second data set ranges approximately from -6 to 6. Draw the chart as shown below:</p>

<title>Statistics - Central limit theorem</title>

<h1>Statistics - Central limit theorem</h1>

<p>If the population from which the sample has a been drawn is a normal population then the <b>sample means</b> would be equal to population mean and the <b>sampling distribution</b> would be normal. When the more population is skewed, as is the case illustrated in Figure, then the <b>sampling distribution</b> would tend to move closer to the normal distribution, provided the sample is large (i.e. greater then 30).</p>

<p>According to <b>Central Limit Theorem</b>, for sufficiently large samples with size greater than 30, the shape of the <b>sampling distribution</b> will become more and more like a <b>normal distribution</b>, irrespective of the shape of the parent population. This theorem explains the relationship between the <b>population distribution</b> and <b>sampling distribution</b>. It highlights the fact that if there are large enough set of samples then the <b>sampling distribution</b> of mean approaches <b>normal distribution</b>. The importance of central limit theorem has been summed up by Richard. I. Levin in the following words:</p>

<title>Statistics - Chebyshev's Theorem</title>

<h1>Statistics - Chebyshev's Theorem</h1>

<p>The fraction of any set of numbers lying within k standard deviations of those numbers of the mean of those numbers is at least</p>

<p>${1-\frac{1}{k^2}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${k = \frac{the\ within\ number}{the\ standard\ deviation}}$</p>

<p>and ${k}$ must be greater than 1</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Use Chebyshev's theorem to find what percent of the values will fall between 123 and 179 for a data set with mean of 151 and standard deviation of 14.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>We subtract 151-123 and get 28, which tells us that 123 is 28 units below the mean.</p>

<p>We subtract 179-151 and also get 28, which tells us that 151 is 28 units above the mean.</p>

<p>Those two together tell us that the values between 123 and 179 are all within 28 units of the mean. Therefore the "within number" is 28.</p>

<p>So we find the number of standard deviations, k, which the "within number", 28, amounts to by dividing it by the standard deviation:</p>

<p>So ${\frac{3}{4}}$ of the data lie between 123 and 179.  And since ${\frac{3}{4} = 75}$% that implies that 75% of the data values are between 123 and 179.</p>

<h1>Statistics - Circular Permutation</h1>

<p>Circular permutation is the total number of ways in which n distinct objects can be arranged around a fix circle. It is of two types.</p>

<p><b>Case 1: </b> - Clockwise and Anticlockwise orders are different.</p>

<title>Statistics - Cluster sampling</title>

<h1>Statistics - Cluster sampling</h1>

<p>In <b>cluster sampling</b>, groups of elements that ideally speaking, are heterogeneous in nature within group, and are chosen randomly. Unlike <b>stratified sampling</b> where groups are homogeneous and few elements are randomly chosen from each group, in <b>cluster sampling</b> the group with intra group heterogeneity are developed and all the elements within the group become a pan of the sample. Whereas <b>stratified sampling</b> has intra group homogeneity and inter group heterogeneity, <b>cluster sampling</b> has intra group heterogeneity.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>One stage cluster sampling</h3>

<p>A committee comprising of number of members from different departments has a high degree of heterogeneity. When from number of such committees, few are chosen randomly, and then it is a case of <b>one stage cluster sampling</b>.</p>

<h3>Two stage cluster sampling</h3>

<p>If from each cluster which has been randomly chosen, few elements are chosen randomly using simple random sampling or any other probability method then it is a <b>two stage cluster sampling</b>.</p>

<h3>Multi-stage cluster sampling</h3>

<p>A cluster sample can be a multiple stage sampling, when the choice of element in a sample involves selection at multiple stages e.g. if in a national survey on insurance products a sample of insurance companies is to be drawn, then it requires developing clusters at multiple stages.</p>

<p>In the first stage the clusters are formed on the basis of public and private companies. At the next stage a group of companies is chosen randomly from each cluster developed earlier. In the third stage the office location of each chosen company from where data is to be collected is chosen randomly. Thus in multistage sampling, probability sampling of primary units is done, then from each primary unit a sample of secondary sampling units is drawn and then the third levels till we reach the final stage of breakdown for the sample units.</p>

<title>Statistics - Cohen's kappa coefficient</title>

<h1>Statistics - Cohen's kappa coefficient</h1>

<p><b>Cohen's kappa coefficient</b> is a statistic which measures inter-rater agreement for qualitative (categorical) items. It is generally thought to be a more robust measure than simple percent agreement calculation, since k takes into account the agreement occurring by chance. Cohen's kappa measures the agreement between two raters who each classify N items into C mutually exclusive categories.</p>

<p>Cohen's kappa coefficient is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${k = \frac{p_0 - p_e}{1-p_e} = 1 - \frac{1-p_o}{1-p_e}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${p_0}$ = relative observed agreement among raters.</p>

<p>${p_e}$ = the hypothetical probability of chance agreement.</p>

<p>${p_0}$ and ${p_e}$ are computed using the observed data to calculate the probabilities of each observer randomly saying each category. If the raters are in complete agreement then ${k}$ = 1. If there is no agreement among the raters other than what would be expected by chance (as given by ${p_e}$), ${k}$ &le; 0.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Suppose that you were analyzing data related to a group of 50 people applying for a grant. Each grant proposal was read by two readers and each reader either said "Yes" or "No" to the proposal. Suppose the disagreement count data were as follows, where A and B are readers, data on the diagonal slanting left shows the count of agreements and the data on the diagonal slanting right, disagreements:</p>

<p>Calculate Cohen's kappa coefficient.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Note that there were 20 proposals that were granted by both reader A and reader B and 15 proposals that were rejected by both readers. Thus, the observed proportionate agreement is</p>

<p>${p_0 = \frac{20+15}{50} = 0.70}$</p>

<p>To calculate ${p_e}$ (the probability of random agreement) we note that:</p>

<p>Reader A said "Yes" to 25 applicants and "No" to 25 applicants. Thus reader A said "Yes" 50% of the time.</p>

<p>Reader B said "Yes" to 30 applicants and "No" to 20 applicants. Thus reader B said "Yes" 60% of the time.</p>

<p>Using formula P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) where P is probability of event occuring.</p>

<p>The probability that both of them would say "Yes" randomly is 0.50 x 0.60 = 0.30 and the probability that both of them would say "No" is 0.50 x 0.40 = 0.20. Thus the overall probability of random agreement is ${p_e}$ = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5.</p>

<p>So now applying our formula for Cohen's Kappa we get:</p>

<p>${k = \frac{p_0 - p_e}{1-p_e} = \frac{0.70 - 0.50}{1-0.50} = 0.40}$</p>

<title>Statistics - Combination</title>

<h1>Statistics - Combination</h1>

<p>A combination is a selection of all or part of a set of objects, without regard to the order in which objects are selected. For example, suppose we have a set of three letters: A, B, and C. we might ask how many ways we can select 2 letters from that set.</p>

<p>Combination is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${C(n,r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<title>Statistics - Continuous Uniform Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Continuous Uniform Distribution</h1>

<p>The continuous uniform distribution is the probability distribution of random number selection from the continuous interval between a and b. Its density function is defined by the following. Here is a graph of the continuous uniform distribution with a = 1, b = 3.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Suppose you are leading a test and present an inquiry on the crowd of 20 contenders. The time permitted to answer the inquiry is 30 seconds. What number of persons is prone to react inside of 5 seconds? (Regularly, the contenders are required to click a catch of the right decision and the champ is picked on the premise of first snap).</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: The interval of the probability distribution in seconds is [0, 30].</p>

<p>Step 2: The requirement is how many will respond in 5 seconds. That is, the sub interval of the successful event is [0, 5]. Now the probability P (x &lt; 5) is the proportion of the widths of these two interval.</p>

<p>Subsequent to there are 20 contenders, the quantity of contenders prone to react in 5 seconds is (1/6) (20) =3.</p>

<title>Statistics - Cumulative Frequency</title>

<h1>Statistics - Cumulative Frequency</h1>

<p>Cumulative frequency is defined as a running total of frequencies. The frequency of an element in a set refers to how many of that element there are in the set. Cumulative frequency can also defined as the sum of all previous frequencies up to the current point.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>The set of data below shows the ages of participants in a certain winter camp. Draw a cumulative frequency table for the data.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>The cumulative frequency at a certain point is found by adding the frequency at the present point to the cumulative frequency of the previous point. The cumulative frequency for the first data point is the same as its frequency since there is no cumulative frequency before it.</p>

<title>Statistics - Co-efficient of Variation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Co-efficient of Variation</h1>

<h2>Coefficient of Variation</h2>

<p>Standard variation is an absolute measure of dispersion. When comparison has to be made between two series then the relative measure of dispersion, known as coeff.of variation is used.</p>

<p>Coefficient of Variation, CV is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${CV = \frac{\sigma}{X} \times 100 }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${CV}$ = Coefficient of Variation.</p>

<p>${\sigma}$ = standard deviation.</p>

<p>${X}$ = mean.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>From the following data. Identify the risky project, is more risky:</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>In order to identify the risky project, we have to identify which of these projects is less consistent in yielding profits. Hence we work out the coefficient of variation.</p>

<p><b>Project X</b></p>

<p><b>Project Y</b></p>

<p>Since coeff.of variation is higher for project X than for project Y, hence despite the average profits being same, project X is more risky.</p>

<title>Statistics - Correlation Co-efficient</title>

<h1>Statistics - Correlation Co-efficient</h1>

<h2>Correlation Co-efficient</h2>

<p>A correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the degree to which changes to the value of one variable predict change to the value of another. In positively correlated variables, the value increases or decreases in tandem. In negatively correlated variables, the value of one increases as the value of the other decreases.</p>

<p>Correlation coefficients are expressed as values between +1 and -1. </p>

<p>A coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation: A change in the value of one variable will predict a change in the same direction in the second variable.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${r = \frac{N \sum xy - (\sum x)(\sum y)}{\sqrt{[N\sum x^2 - (\sum x)^2][N\sum y^2 - (\sum y)^2]}}  }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = Number of pairs of scores</p>

<p>${\sum xy}$ = Sum of products of paired scores.</p>

<p>${\sum x}$ = Sum of x scores.</p>

<p>${\sum y}$ = Sum of y scores.</p>

<p>${\sum x^2}$ = Sum of squared x scores.</p>

<p>${\sum y^2}$ = Sum of squared y scores.</p>

<title>Statistics - Data Collection</title>

<h1>Statistics - Data Collection</h1>

<p>The data required for a research can be primary or secondary in nature. Primary data, by definition is the date that has been collected first hand by the researcher specially for addressing the population at hand. A survey research can be objectivist or subjectivist in nature. An objectivist approach is a more rigid and scientific approach. In this the hypothesis is tested using publicly standard procedure. There is little or no latitude available to deviate from the stated procedures or questions. A subjectivist approach, requires a hypothesis test, but is not that rigid in following the procedures. The researcher is allowed to use unstructured methods, at his discretion, to record data. The research data can be classified as follows:</p>

<h2>Interview</h2>

<p>A form of communication approach to collecting data from respondent's interview is to oral or verbal questioning. Bingham and Moore have described interview as 'conversation with a purpose.' Lindsey Gardner, has defined interview as a 'two-person conversation, initiated by the interviewer for the specific purpose of obtaining research-relevant information and focused by him on the content specified by the research objectives of description and explanation.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that interview is a verbal conversation between two people with the objective of collecting research relevant information from the respondent. Interview can be classified into various types' viz., personal interview, telephone interview, focus group interview, depth interview and projective techniques also called as indirect interviewing.</p>

<h2>Type of Interview</h2>

<p>The interview techniques can be grouped in the following categories:</p>

<h3>Personal Interview</h3>

<p>A Personal interview is a face to face way communication between the interviewer and the respondent. Generally the personal interview is carried out in a planned manner and is referred to as 'structured interview'. The personal interviews can be conducted in many forms e.g. door to door interviewing where the respondents are interviewed in their home, or as planned formal executive meeting, most commonly used to interview officials and business persons, or as a mall intercept survey where respondents are interviewed at select places where the chances of finding respondents is maximum.</p>

<h4>Method of Conducting an Interview</h4>

<p>A personal interview involves a lot of preparation. Generally an interview should go through the following stages.</p>

<p><b>Rapport Building</b> - The first reaction of a respondent on being asked to give interview is to say 'No'. Hence in the initial stage the interviewer should increase the receptiveness of the respondent by making him believe that his opinions are very useful to the research, and the interview is going to be a pleasure rather than an ordeal. It is important that the interviewer should convey his confidence to the respondent and satisfy his mental reservations if any. Wherever possible an appointment should be sought.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b> - An introduction involves the interviewer identifying himself by giving him his name, purpose and sponsorship if any. An introductory letter goes a long way in conveying the study's legitimacy. If the respondent is unavailable, then the interviewer should ensure that he seeks a reappoint.</p>

<p><b>Probing</b> - In this stage the interviewer collects data by asking questions from an interview schedule which contains questions in prearranged sequence. Generally the questions should be asked the way they are worded in order to avoid bias, but if they are not understood or heard properly they may be repealed. An advantage of interview is that it allows for probing. Probing is the technique of encouraging the respondents to answer freely, completely and relevantly. Some of the frequently used probing styles are use of comments like "I understand", "Uh-huh", repeating the respondents reply to incite him to rethink his reply, give an expectant out pause to convey interest etc. However probing should be used carefully and should not bias the respondent's reply.</p>

<p><b>Recording</b> - The last stage in an interview, is recording responses. The interviewer 'can either write the response at the time of interview or after the interview. Normally, the recording should take place side by side. The interviewer can use short hand and abbreviate responses. Recording response later on has the disadvantage that one way forgets what had been said earlier. In certain cases, where the respondent allows for it, audio or visual aids can be used to record answers.</p>

<p><b>Closing</b> - After the interview is over, the interviewer should thank the respondent and once again assure him about the worth of his answers and the confidentiality of the same.</p>

<h3>Telephone interview</h3>

<p>In telephone interviewing the information is collected from the respondent by asking the questions on phone. The marriage of telephone and computer has made this method even more popular.  Traditional telephone interviews call for phoning a sample of respondents, asking them questions written on a paper and recording them with a pencil. In case of Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) uses a computerized questionnaire is used which prompts the interviewer with introductory statements, and qualifying questions to be asked to the respondents.</p>

<p>The computer replaces the paper and pen. The computer randomly dials a number from the sample; upon contact the interviewer reads the questions and diret1y into the computer's memory bank. Another variant is 'Computer Administered Telephone Surveys (CATS) where the interviewer is replaced by computer. The questions are voice synthesized and the respondent's answer and computer timing decide whether to continue or disconnect. The chief disadvantage of this method is that the rejection of this mode of data collection affects the refusal rate (and thus non-response bias) because people hang up more easily on a computer than on a human Telephone interview has the following advantages over personal interview:</p>

<p>Low cost</p>

<p>Faster collection of data</p>

<p>Reduces biases (caused by personal presence of interviewer)</p>

<h3>Focus group interview</h3>

<p>A kind of unstructured interview. It involves a moderator leading discussion between small groups of respondents on a specified topic. A focus group interview involves 8 to 12 respondents having homogeneous characteristics, seated in a comfortable relaxed informal atmosphere. The interview generally continues for 1 to 3 hour during which the respondents develop a rapport and share their views. The proceedings are recorded on an audio or visual device. The moderator keeps the discussion going and probes the respondents whenever necessary to elicit insightful responses. These responses are better analyzed to derive conclusive results. Focus group interview results in advantages summed up as following 10 "S"</p>

<p><b>Synergism</b> - When group of people produce better insight into a problem than individual.</p>

<p><b>Snowballing</b> - One person's response initiates a chain of responses.</p>

<p><b>Stimulation</b> - As the interview progress respondents are more and more encouraged to give responses.</p>

<p><b>Security</b> - Since an individual generally finds somebody in the group who might endorse his opinion, he feels secure in answering.</p>

<p><b>Spontaneity</b> - Since there are no pre designed questions being asked, responses are spontaneous.</p>

<p><b>Serendipity</b> - Often new ideas are generated.</p>

<p><b>Specialization</b> - Since response is being sought from large numberof respondents, the interviewer or moderator is a highly trained person.</p>

<p><b>Scientific Scrutiny</b> - Since the proceedings are being recorded, they can be analyzed in a great detail scientifically.</p>

<p><b>Structure</b> - It allows for topic to be discussed flexibly and in great depth.</p>

<p><b>Speed</b> - Since a large number of respondents are being interviewed simultaneously, data is collected quickly.</p>

<p>However, like the two sides of a coin, focus group interview suffers from certain disadvantages like; the results can be wrongly interpreted since the response is not to any specific question. Focus group interviews make coding and analysis of data also very difficult. Most importantly, it is difficult to find a moderator who can conduct these interviews successfully.</p>

<h3>Depth interviews</h3>

<p>In depth interviews, the interviewer asks the initial question and thereafter it is the response of the respondents from which further questions may be generated. The interviewer using probing techniques looks for more elaboration.</p>

<p>The interviewer only follows a rough outline of questions. The depth interviews have the advantage of uncovering much uncovering much deeper feelings and insights than focus group interviews, since they are dealing with just one respondent. However it suffers from the drawback of being expensive, time consuming and demands skilled interviewer.</p>

<h3>Projective Techniques</h3>

<p>The techniques involve highly unstructured and indirect form of questioning. The central feature of all projective techniques that is the presentation of an ambiguous, unstructured object, activity or person that to respondent is asked to interpret and explain. These techniques are best suited in situation where the respondent is not sure of his feelings and hence cannot express his answers directly. The projective techniques can be classified as construction techniques, association techniques and completion techniques.</p>

<p>In projective techniques, the respondents are asked to interpret the behavior of others and this way they indirectly reveal their own behavior in the same situation. Some of these techniques are discussed below.</p>

<p><b>Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)</b> - The respondent is shown a set of pictures and then asked what he perceives of these pictures. e.g. he might be shown a picture of students holding protest banners and his perception of what he interprets from the picture is sought.</p>

<p><b>Item Substitution Test.</b> This test involves creating two groups of respondents, the test group and the control group. The stimulus, presented as a list of items, is given to both the groups which is similar in all respect except for the substitution of items relevant to the study e.g. a shopping list is given to both the groups with one list having Maggie noodles which gets substituted by 'Top Ramen' noodles and the shopper's characteristics can be judged.</p>

<p><b>Word Association Test</b> - Respondents are presented with a list of words one at a time and they are asked to respond immediately with the first things that come to their mind e. g. in a study on TV viewing habits the respondents can be presented with words like 'discovery', 'soap', 'idiot', 'star' etc. This method allows respondents to reveal their inner feelings on the topic.</p>

<p><b>Rorschach Test</b> - It consists of ten cards that have print of ink blots that are although symmetrical but defy all meaning. The respondents are asked to interpret these cards/inkblots and their responses are interpreted on the basis of some predetermined framework.</p>

<p><b>Cloud Picture Test</b> - This shows two or more characters conversing with each other and cloud of one character is left empty as a response to be filled by the respondent according to his interpretation of what the other characters are saying. It could even be a single character with an empty cloud overhead indicating his would be response to a particular situation.</p>

<p><b>Sentence Completition Test</b> - It is similar to a word association test where instead of a word, a sentence is left incomplete and the respondent is asked to fill it with the first thought that comes to his mind e. g.</p>

<p>People who enter politics are...................................................................</p>

<p>A person who gives money to a charity is.................................................</p>

<p>Analysis of the response helps a researcher in concluding about the attitudes of people to various objects or subjects.</p>

<p><b>Story Completion Study</b> - A step further to sentence completion is the story completion study: Under this a story is created by the researcher which defines the topic of research and the respondents are asked to complete the story.</p>

<title>Statistics - Data collection - Questionaire Designing</title>

<h1>Statistics - Data collection - Questionaire Designing</h1>

<p>A questionnaire is a form containing a set of questions, which are filled by the respondents. According to Goode Hatt,</p>

<p>The objective of a questionnaire is twofold:</p>

<p>To collect information from respondent scattered in a wide area.</p>

<p>To achieve success in collecting reliable and dependable information in a short span of time.</p>

<h2>QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN</h2>

<p>Designing of questionnaire is an art rather than a science. It is an effort of compiling a set of questions by repeatedly checking out for errors, of learning what to avoid and what to include. However a basic design strategy can be e developed. The designing of questionnaire general1y goes through three phases</p>

<p>Developing a design strategy</p>

<p>Constructing the questionnaire</p>

<p>Drafting and refining the questionnaire.</p>

<h3>Phase I: Developing A Design, Strategy</h3>

<p><b>Specify the Information Sought</b> - The researcher should be able to specify the list of information needs. Generally this task has already been accomplished when the research proposal or the research design was developed. The hypothesis stated earlier is the guiding light in stating the information requirement. The hypothesis establishes the relationship between the variables and the researcher can ideally develop the data that is required to he collected to prove or disapprove the hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Determine the Communication Approach</b> - It refers to the decision on the method used to conduct the survey i.e. personal interview, depth interview, telephone, mail. computer etc. This decision on method to be used will have a bearing on the type of questionnaire to design. The choice of communication approach is influenced by factors like to location of respondents, the time funds available, nature of study etc. The communication approach chosen results in different introductions, different instructions, layout etc. Once the communication approach has been finalized, a decision is then taken on the type of questionnaire that is to be framed.</p>

<p><b>Type of Questionnaire</b> - In this step the researcher specifies how the data will be gathered by stating the type of questionnaire required. The questionnaire can be of four types.</p>

<p><b>Structured-Undisguised Questionnaire</b> - The most popular type, it involves using questions with clear direct wording, having a logical order. The wording and order remains the same for all the respondents. They are very simple to administer and easy to tabulate.</p>

<p><b>Unstructured-Disguised Questionnaire</b> - The exact opposite of the earlier type, this questionnaire hides the purpose of research and shows no clear order or tendencies. Such a questionnaire generally uses projective methods to collect data. A disguised or hidden stimulus is given to the respondent and the response is in an unstructured form.</p>

<p><b>Unstructured-Undisguised Questionnaire</b> - In this type of questionnaire the purpose of the study is clear but the questions are generally open ended. e.g. "How do you feel about putting a ban on student union election?" The respondents are free to reply in an unstructured manner. These questionnaires are generally used in depth interviews.</p>

<p><b>Structured-Disguised Questionnaire.</b> - The purpose of this questionnaire is to hide the motive of study but allow for ease in coding and analysis. This approach is based on the fact that direct questions may influence or bias the replies, but if the questions. are disguised than we ask the respondents What they know and not what they feel e.g. the earlier question will be framed as</p>

<p>What is the effect of student union election?</p>

<p>(a) It creates awareness</p>

<p>(b) It disrupts studies</p>

<p>(C).............................</p>

<p>(d).............................</p>

<p>Although such questionnaire offer ease of tabulation and analysis, yet because of the effort involved in framing disguised questions, this is not a every popular method.</p>

<h3>Phase II: Constructing the Questionnaire</h3>

<p><b>Determine Question Content</b> - This step initiates the task of framing specific questions which would yield the data required for study. While framing the questions certain things should be kept in mind:</p>

<p>Is the question necessary? Every question should have some use in providing additional and genuine information.</p>

<p>Is the question complete? The question should have the proper scope to reveal all the information that a researcher needs to know.</p>

<p>Is a single question or multiple questions required? There should not be 'double barreled questions' which combine two questions in one e.g. 'Are the elections this year transparent and according to election commission guidelines'. This is an incorrect method. Instead to obtain the desired information the following two questions should have been asked :</p>

<p>Are the elections this year transparent?</p>

<p>Where the election commission guidelines adhered to completely.</p>

<p>Can the respondent articulate? The respondent may be unable to answer adequately due to his inability to organize his thoughts.</p>

<p>Is the respondent informed? The respondent's information level should be kept in mind i.e. the content of the question should match the knowledge level of the respondent.</p>

<p>Can the respondent remember? The questions should not overtax the respondent s recall ability. No assumption should he made regarding the memory. Take a simple test and answer these questions:</p>

<p>What was the last movie you saw?</p>

<p>Where did you last eat out?</p>

<p>When did you visit a temple?</p>

<p>These questions, although very simple, yet test your recall ability.</p>

<p>Is the respondent willing to answer? This is of relevance in situation where the questions are sensitive exploring an individual's faith, money matters, family life etc.</p>

<p><b>Determine the Response Strategy</b>Once the content of questions has been decided upon, the next stage is to decide on the structured response strategy. (close response using fixed alternative questions) or an unstructured response strategy open response using open ended questions). Some of the response strategies are:</p>

<p>Dichotomous questions</p>

<p>Do you own a digital camera?</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Yes</checkbox><input type="checkbox" >No</checkbox></p>

<p>Multichotomous questions</p>

<p>Which brand do you prefer for buy a digital camera?</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Sony</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Cannon</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Nikon</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Kodak</checkbox></p>

<p>Checklist questions</p>

<p>What features do you look for in your digital camera?</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Picture clarity</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Screen size</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Video recording facility</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Economical</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Smart physical looks</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Free service for 1 year</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Large memory capacity</checkbox></p>

<p>Scale questions may be of the rating or ranking type</p>

<h4>Ranking</h4>

<p>Which of the following media has been instrumental in influencing your choice of digital camera? Rank them giving 1 to the most effective media, 2 to the next most and so on.</p>

<h4>Rating</h4>

<p>Of the following factors, rate each factor in terms of the 'most desired', 'some what desired' and 'least desired' that digital camera should possess.</p>

<p><b>Determine the Question's Wording</b> - This state is concerned with the phrasing of each question. The researcher needs to use utmost caution in framing the question since a poorly phrased question will either lead to a wrong response of result in refusal to answer. While wording a question the following things should be kept in mind:</p>

<p><b>Use simple words</b> - The questionnaire is not a test of respondent's vocabulary, hence the words should be simple e.g. 'where, in your opinion, does the forte of this organization lie? Since some may not know the meaning of word 'forte', hence it is better if it is phrased simply as 'Where in your opinion, does the strength of this organizationally?'</p>

<p><b>Avoid technical jargon</b> - Use of technical words may render even the highly educated respondents helpless in answering the questions.</p>

<p><b>Avoid using ambiguous questions</b> - words like 'occasionally', 'often', 'sometimes', 'you' etc. are all problem words e.g.</p>

<p>How often do you watch movies in a theatre?</p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Never</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Occasionally</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Sometimes</checkbox></p>

<p><input type="checkbox" >Often</checkbox></p>

<p>This question is worthless since everybody has a different interpretation of occasionally and sometimes.</p>

<p><b>Avoid biased wording</b> - Questions that lead respondent towards an answer, give him a clue to the questions, are biased or leading questions. Such questions should be avoided since they distort the intent of the question e.g.</p>

<p>'Do you think government is doing right by allowing FDI in retail sector?'</p>

<p>'Do you consider it appropriate to use low cost accessories for your car?'</p>

<p>These questions force a respondent to think in a particular direction.</p>

<p>Increase defence expenditure, even if it means more taxes. The alternative can also be written as</p>

<p>Increase defence expenditure even if you have to pay more tax.</p>

<p>The second alternative is more personalized and both these alternatives will produce different results. There is no fixed rule to say which method is to be used. However one should choose that level of personalization which presents the issue more realistically.</p>

<h3>Phase III: Drafting and Refining the Questionnaire</h3>

<p><b>Decide On Question Sequence</b> - From this step, we enter the stage of drafting the questionnaire and the ordering of questions is an important aspect. The following things need to be kept in mind:</p>

<p>Use simple and interesting Question first. It makes the respondent feel comfortable. An alternative is to use 'funnel approach' whereby broad questions are asked first and specific questions are asked later on.</p>

<p>The questions should be arranged in a logical order. Jumping from topic to topic would break the flow of respondent and he would lose interest in filling the questionnaire.</p>

<p>Classification questions should be asked later on. Classification questionnaire the personal questions. The reason for asking classification question before target questions is to avoid alienating the respondent before getting to the heart of study e.g. respondents who readily offer their opinion on preferred car types would most likely balk from responding with same freedom if their income is asked first.</p>

<p>Difficult and sensitive questions should be asked right in the beginning of the questionnaire so as to avoid threatening the respondent.</p>

<p>Branching of questions should be done with care. Branching refers to directing the respondent where to go next in the questionnaire on the basis of his answer to preceding questions. Branching is easier in case of telephone or personal interview schedule but when the questionnaire is to be mailed; branching should be avoided as it may confuse the respondent.</p>

<p><b>Determine the Physical Characteristics</b> - The physical appearance affects the way the respondents react to the questionnaire. Hence the following points should be observed:</p>

<p>Use a good quality paper with high definition ink so that it can be read easily. The questionnaire should look professional and easy to answer.</p>

<p>Size of the questionnaire is important. Small questionnaire is preferred to a lengthy one provided the small size is not achieved at the expense of appearance. If a small size is achieved by making the questionnaire crowded then it will lead to errors and result in less informative answers.</p>

<p>A questionnaire should be accompanied by an introductory letter. It should introduce the study and male the respondent realizes the worth of his powers. The importance of research and the importance of respondent's replies should be conveyed through the letter.</p>

<p>The instructions should be written clearly and politely. The method of reporting the responses i.e. tick mark, cross or circle should stated clearly. If the respondent is to skip certain questions then 'go to' instructions should be used and if an entire section is to be skipped then different colors for different sections should be used.</p>

<p><b>Pre-Testing the questionnaires</b> - The process of using a questionnaire on a trial basis on a small group of respondents to determine how the questionnaire is performing is termed as pre-testing. Pre-testing helps to find out the errors in individual questions along with the sequence of questions. Various aspects like the ability of questionnaire to generate respondent's interest, the interpretation of the meaning of questions, the continuity of the questions, the time required  to fill the questionnaire can be tested through pre-testing, Pretesting can be classified as follows:</p>

<p><b>Researcher Pre-testing</b> - This involves a small group of fellow researchers testing the instrument in the initial stages of design. These researchers can provide valuable input to improving the questionnaire.</p>

<p><b>Respondent Pre-testing</b> - In this, pre-testing is done by a small sample drawn from the target respondent population. The instruments in its ready form are administered to the sample and then inputs can he taken from them on the questionnaire.</p>

<p><b>Collaborative Pre-testing</b> - When the respondents are told about the role in pre-testing then it becomes a collaborative pre-test. In such a pre-testing detailed probing of each and every question is done and it is usually a time consuming process.</p>

<p><b>Non-Collaborative Pre-test</b> - When the respondents are not told about their role in pre-testing becomes non-collaborative pre-test. Since they are not being told, their cooperation will be relatively less comprehensive. However this approach has the advantage that it is conducted in situation exactly similar to the real environment.</p>

<title>Statistics - Data collection - Observation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Data collection - Observation</h1>

<p>Observation is a popular method of data collection in behavioral sciences. The power, observation has been summed by W.L. Prosser as follows</p>

<p>Observation refers to the monitoring and recording of behavioral and non behavioral activities and conditions in a systematic manner to obtain information about the phenomena of interest, 'Behavioral Observation' is:</p>

<p>Non verbal analysis like body movement. eye movement.</p>

<p>Linguistic analysis which includes observing sounds like ohs! and abs!</p>

<p>Extra linguistic analysis which observes the pitch timbre, rate of speaking etc.</p>

<p>Spatial analysis about how people relate to each other.</p>

<p>The non behavioral observation is an analysis of records e.g. newspaper archives, physical condition analysis such as checking the quality of grains in gunny bags and process analysis which includes observing any process. Observation can be classified into various, categories.</p>

<h2>Type of Observation</h2>

<p><b>Structured Vs. Unstructured Observation</b> - In structured observation the problem has been clearly defined, hence the behavior to be observed and the method by which it will be measured is specified beforehand in detail. This reduces the chances of observer introducing observer's bias in research e.g. study of p1ant safety compliance can be observed in a structure manner.</p>

<p>Unstructured analysis is used in situations where the problem has not been clearly defined hence it cannot be pre specified that what is to be observed. Hence a researcher monitors all relevant phenomena and a great deal of flexibility is allowed in terms of what they note and record e.g. the student's behavior in a class would require monitoring their total behavior in the class environment. The data collected through unstructured analysis should be analyzed carefully so that no bias is introduced.</p>

<p><b>Disguised Vs. Undisguised Observation</b> - This classification has been done on the basis of whether the subjects should know that they are being observed or not. In disguised observation, the subjects are unaware of the facts that they are being observed. Their behavior is observed using hidden cameras, one way mirrors, or other devices. Since the subjects are unaware that they are being observed hence they behave in a natural way. The drawback is that it may take long hours of observation before the subjects display the phenomena of interest. Disguised observation may be:</p>

<p>Direct observation when the behavior is observed by the researcher himself personally.</p>

<p>Indirect observation which is the effect or the result of the behavior that is observed.</p>

<p>In undisguised observation, the subjects are aware that they are being observed. In this type of observation, there is the fear that the subject might show a typical activity. The entry of observer may upset the subject, but for how long this disruption will exist cannot be said conclusively. Studies have shown that such descriptions are short-lived and the subjects soon resume normal behavior.</p>

<p><b>Participant vs. Non-Participant Observation</b> - If the observer participates in the situation while observing it is termed as participant observation. g. a researcher studying the life style of slum dwellers, following participant observation, will himself stay in slums. His role as an observer may be concealed or revealed. By becoming a part of the setting he is able to observe in an insightful manner. A problem that arises out of this method is that the observer may become sympathetic to the subjects and would have problem in viewing his research objectively.</p>

<p>In case of non-participant observation, the observer remains outside the setting and does not involve himself or participate in the situation.</p>

<p><b>Natural vs. Contrived Observation.</b> - In natural observation the behavior is observed as it takes place in the actual setting e.g. the consumer preferences observed directly at Pizza Hut where consumers are ordering pizza. The advantage of this method is that the true results are obtained, but it is expensive and time consuming method.</p>

<p>In contrived observation, the phenomena is observed in an artificial or simulated setting e.g. the consumers instead of being observed in a restaurant are made to order in a setting that looks like a restaurant but is not an actual one. This type of observation has the advantage of being over in a short time and recording of behavior is easily done. However, since the consumer's are conscious of their setting they may not show actual behavior.</p>

<p><b>Classification on the Basis of Mode of Administration</b> - This includes: monitors and records the behavior as it occurs. The recording is done on an observation schedule. The personal observation not only records what, has been specified but also identifies and records unexpected behaviors that defy pre-established response categories.</p>

<p><b>Mechanical Observation</b> - Mechanical devices, instead of human's are to record the behavior. The devices record the behavior as it occurs and data is sorted and analyzed later on. Apart from cameras, other devices are galvanometer which measures the emotional arousal induced by an exposure to a specific stimuli, audiometer and people meter that record which channel on TV is being viewed with the latter also recording who is viewing the channel, coulometer records the eye movement etc.</p>

<p><b>Audit</b> - It is the process of obtaining information by physical examination of data. The audit, which is a count of physical objects, is generally done by the researcher himself. An audit can be a store audit or a pantry audit. The store audits are performed by the distributors or manufacturers in order to ana1yse the market share, purchase pattern etc. e.g. the researcher may check the store records or do an analysis of inventory on hand to record the data. The pantry audit involves the researcher developing an inventory of brands quantities and package sizes of products in a consumer's home, generally in the course of a personal interview. Such an audit is used to supplement or test the truthfulness of information provided in the direct questionnaire.</p>

<p><b>Content Analysis</b> - Content analysis is the objective, systematic and initiative description of the manifest content of communication. This method consists of observation and analysis. It involves analysis of the contents of a communication spoken or printed. Through content analysis a quantitative analysis of the presence of a certain characteristic in a document can be done by identifying and counting the presence of a certain characteristic e.g. If we want to find out which- politicians frequently use secularism in their speech, then certain key words which are synonymous with secularism are identified. Next the speech of various politicians is analyzed to observe the numbers of times the keywords have appeared. The politician whose speech has the maximum number of key words appearing in its content is the one who uses secularism frequently to woo voters however these days' content analysis is used for qualitative analysis whereby the general message of the document is analyzed.</p>

<h2>Conducting an Observation Study</h2>

<p>While conducting an observation study, care should be taken that it is free from errors and bias: The following basic steps can be followed.</p>

<p><b>Specify the type of, study.</b> If the, study is exploratory in nature then even simple observation will suffice. In other studies the more systematic. Depending on the environment of study the observation could be unstructured or it could be structured.</p>

<p><b>Specify the contents of observation.</b> The researcher should specify the variables of interest which, are to be observed along with other variables which influence the study, For each variable identified, its definition and the measurement terms to be used to record the results should be specified.</p>

<p><b>Observer training.</b> An observer has to be trained to record and observe the right things. He should have the ability to remember details, to objectively view the phenomena of interest and have high concentration. The more unstructured an observation, the greater the dependency on observer for securing the research results. Hence an observer's experience in such a situation becomes necessary.</p>

<p><b>Develop an observation form.</b> The observation form is an observation plan which addresses the following:</p>

<p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>What i.e. the aspects which are to be observed. The characteristics that are to be observed need to be specified.<li><p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>When i.e. the time of observation. It has to be decided whether the observation is to be conducted at a particular time or any time is the right time.<li><p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>Where i.e. the place where the observation is to be made. The methodology used to select the place where observation is to be done is also to be specified.<li><p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>How i.e. the method of observation. The details regarding how the data will be observed i.e. directly or indirectly, by single or multiple observers, through personal or mechanical method, all should be stated.<li><p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>Once the plan. Is drafted the observer is ready to monitor and record the phenomena of interest.<li><p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<p>Who i.e. the subjects, the intermediaries who are to be studied and who help in studying, respectively.</p>

<title>Statistics - Data collection - Case Study Method</title>

<h1>Statistics - Data collection - Case Study Method</h1>

<p>Case study research is a qualitative research method that is used to examine contemporary real-life situations and apply the findings of the case to the problem under study. Case studies involve a detailed contextual analysis of a limited number of events or conditions and their relationships. It provides the basis for the application of ideas and extension of methods. It helps a researcher to understand a complex issue or object and add strength to what is already known through previous research.</p>

<h2>STEPS OF CASE STUDY METHOD</h2>

<p>In order to ensure objectivity and clarity, a researcher should adopt a methodical approach to case studies research. The following steps can be followed:</p>

<p><b>Identify and define the research questions</b> - The researcher starts with establishing the focus of the study by identifying the research object and the problem surrounding it. The research object would be a person, a program, an event or an entity.</p>

<p><b>Select the cases</b> -  In this step the researcher decides on the number of cases to choose (single or multiple), the type of cases to choose (unique or typical) and the approach to collect, store and analyze the data. This is the design phase of the case study method. </p>

<p><b>Collect the data</b> -  The researcher now collects the data with the objective of gathering multiple sources of evidence with reference to the problem under study. This evidence is stored comprehensively and systematically in a format that can be referenced and sorted easily so that converging lines of inquiry and patterns can be uncovered.</p>

<p><b>Evaluate and analyze the data</b> -  In this step the researcher makes use of varied methods to analyze qualitative as well as quantitative data. The data is categorized, tabulated and cross checked to address the initial propositions or purpose of the study. Graphic techniques like placing information into arrays, creating matrices of categories, creating flow charts etc. are used to help the investigators to approach the data from different ways and thus avoid making premature conclusions. Multiple investigators may also be used to examine the data so that a wide variety of insights to the available data can be developed. </p>

<p><b>Presentation of Results</b> -  The results are presented in a manner that allows the reader to evaluate the findings in the light of the evidence presented in the report. The results are corroborated with sufficient evidence showing that all aspects of the problem have been adequately explored. The newer insights gained and the conflicting propositions that have emerged are suitably highlighted in the report.</p>

<title>Statistics - Data Patterns</title>

<h1>Statistics - Data Patterns</h1>

<h2>Center</h2>

<p>The center of a distribution, graphically, is located at the median of the distribution. Such a graphic chart displays that almost half of the observations are on either side. Height of each column indicates the frequency of observations.</p>

<h2>Spread</h2>

<p>The spread of a distribution refers to the variation of the data. If the set of observation covers a wide range, the spread is larger. If the observations are centered around a single value, then the spread is smaller.</p>

<h2>Shape</h2>

<p>The shape of a distribution can described using following characteristics.</p>

<p><b>Symmetry</b> - In symmetric distribution, graph can be divided at the center in such a way that each half is a mirror image of the other.</p>

<p><b>Number of peaks.</b> - Distributions with one or multiple peaks. Distribution with one clear peak is known as unimodal, and distribution with two clear peaks is called bimodal. A single peak symmetric distribution at the center, is referred to as bell-shaped.</p>

<p><b>Skewness</b> - Some distributions may have multiple observations on one side of the graph than the other side. Distributions having fewer observations towards lower values are said to be skewed right; and distributions with fewer observations towards lower values are said to be skewed left.</p>

<p><b>Uniform</b> - When the set of observations has no peak and have data equally spread across the range of the distribution, then the distribution is called a uniform distribution.</p>

<h2>Unusual Features</h2>

<p>Common unusual features of data patterns are gaps and outliers.</p>

<p><b>Gaps</b> - Gaps points to areas of a distribution having no observations. Following figure has a gap as there are no observations in the middle of the distribution.</p>

<p><b>Outliers</b> - Distributions may be characterized by extreme values that differ greatly from the other set of observation data. These extreme values are refered as outliers. Following figure illustrates a distribution with an outlier.</p>

<title>Statistics - F Test Table</title>

<h1>Statistics - F Test Table</h1>

<p>F-test is named after the more prominent analyst R.A. Fisher. F-test is utilized to test whether the two autonomous appraisals of populace change contrast altogether or whether the two examples may be viewed as drawn from the typical populace having the same difference. For doing the test, we calculate F-statistic is defined as:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${F} = \frac{Larger\ estimate\ of\ population\ variance}{smaller\ estimate\ of\ population\ variance} = \frac{{S_1}^2}{{S_2}^2}\ where\ {{S_1}^2} \gt {{S_2}^2}$</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Its testing procedure is as follows:</p>

<p>Set up null hypothesis that the two population variance are equal. i.e. ${H_0: {\sigma_1}^2 = {\sigma_2}^2}$ </p>

<p>The variances of the random samples are calculated by using formula:</p>

<p>The variance ratio F is computed as:</p>

<p>${F} = \frac{{S_1}^2}{{S_2}^2}\ where\ {{S_1}^2} \gt {{S_2}^2}$</p>

<p>The degrees of freedom are computed. The degrees of freedom of the larger estimate of the population variance are denoted by v1 and the smaller estimate by v2. That is, </p>

<p>${v_1}$ = degrees of freedom for sample having larger variance = ${n_1-1}$</p>

<p>${v_2}$ = degrees of freedom for sample having smaller variance = ${n_2-1}$</p>

<p>Then from the F-table given at the end of the book, the value of ${F}$ is found for ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ with 5% level of significance.</p>

<p>Then we compare the calculated value of ${F}$ with the table value of ${F_.05}$ for ${v_1}$ and ${v_2}$ degrees of freedom. If the calculated value of ${F}$ exceeds the table value of ${F}$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference between the two variances is significant. On the other hand, if the calculated value of ${F}$ is less than the table value, the null hypothesis is accepted and concludes that both the samples illustrate the applications of F-test.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>In a sample of 8 observations, the entirety of squared deviations of things from the mean was 94.5. In another specimen of 10 perceptions, the worth was observed to be 101.7 Test whether the distinction is huge at 5% level. (You are given that at 5% level of centrality, the basic estimation of ${F}$ for ${v_1}$ = 7 and ${v_2}$ = 9, ${F_.05}$ is 3.29).</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Let us take the hypothesis that the difference in the variances of the two samples is not significant i.e. ${H_0: {\sigma_1}^2 = {\sigma_2}^2}$</p>

<p>We are given the following:</p>

<p>Applying F-Test</p>

<p>${F} = \frac{{S_1}^2}{{S_2}^2} = \frac {13.5}{11.3} = {1.195}$</p>

<p>For ${v_1}$ = 8-1 = 7, ${v_2}$ = 10-1 = 9 and ${F_.05}$ = 3.29. The Calculated value of ${F}$ is less than the table value. Hence, we accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in the variances of two samples is not significant at 5% level.</p>

<title>Statistics - Frequency Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Frequency Distribution</h1>

<p>Frequency distribution is a table that displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample. Each entry in the table contains the frequency or count of the occurrences of values within a particular group or interval, and in this way, the table summarizes the distribution of values in the sample.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Constructing a frequency distribution table of a survey was taken on Maple Avenue. In each of 20 homes, people were asked how many cars were registered to their households. The results were recorded as follows:</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Steps to be followed for present this data in a frequency distribution table.</p>

<p>Divide the results (x) into intervals, and then count the number of results in each interval. In this case, the intervals would be the number of households with no car (0), one car (1), two cars (2) and so forth.</p>

<p>Make a table with separate columns for the interval numbers (the number of cars per household), the tallied results, and the frequency of results in each interval. Label these columns Number of cars, Tally and Frequency.</p>

<p>Read the list of data from left to right and place a tally mark in the appropriate row. For example, the first result is a 1, so place a tally mark in the row beside where 1 appears in the interval column (Number of cars). The next result is a 2, so place a tally mark in the row beside the 2, and so on. When you reach your fifth tally mark, draw a tally line through the preceding four marks to make your final frequency calculations easier to read.</p>

<p>Add up the number of tally marks in each row and record them in the final column entitled Frequency.</p>

<p>Your frequency distribution table for this exercise should look like this:</p>

<p>By looking at this frequency distribution table quickly, we can see that out of 20 households surveyed, 4 households had no cars, 6 households had 1 car.</p>

<title>Statistics - Geometric Probability Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Geometric Probability Distribution</h1>

<p>The geometric distribution is a special case of the negative binomial distribution. It deals with the number of trials required for a single success. Thus, the geometric distribution is a negative binomial distribution where the number of successes (r) is equal to 1.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${P(X=x) = p \times q^{x-1} }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${p}$ = probability of success for single trial.</p>

<p>${q}$ = probability of failure for a single trial (1-p)</p>

<p>${x}$ = the number of failures before a success.</p>

<p>${P(X-x)}$ = Probability of x successes in n trials.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>In an amusement fair, a competitor is entitled for a prize if he throws a ring on a peg from a certain distance. It is observed that only 30% of the competitors are able to do this. If someone is given 5 chances, what is the probability of his winning the prize when he has already missed 4 chances?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>If someone has already missed four chances and has to win in the fifth chance, then it is a probability experiment of getting the first success in 5 trials. The problem statement also suggests the probability distribution to be geometric. The probability of success is given by the geometric distribution formula:</p>

<p>${P(X=x) = p \times q^{x-1} }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${p = 30 \% = 0.3 }$ </p>

<p>${x = 5}$ = the number of failures before a success.</p>

<p>Therefore, the required probability:</p>

<title>Statistics - Goodness of Fit</title>

<h1>Statistics - Goodness of Fit</h1>

<p>The <b>Goodness of Fit</b> test is used to check the sample data whether it fits from a distribution of a population. Population may have normal distribution or Weibull distribution. In simple words, it signifies that sample data represents the data correctly that we are expecting to find from actual population. Following tests are generally used by statisticians:</p>

<p>Chi-square</p>

<p>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</p>

<p>Anderson-Darling</p>

<p>Shipiro-Wilk</p>

<h2>Chi-square Test</h2>

<p>The chi-square test is the most commonly used to test the goodness of fit tests and is used for discrete distributions like the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution, whereas The Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling goodness of fit tests are used for continuous distributions.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${O_i}$ = observed value of i th level of variable.</p>

<p>${E_i}$ = expected value of i th level of variable.</p>

<p>${X^2}$ = chi-squared random variable.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>A toy company builts football player toys. It claims that 30% of the cards are mid-fielders, 60% defenders, and 10% are forwards. Considering a random sample of 100 toys has 50 mid-fielders, 45 defenders, and 5 forwards. Given 0.05 level of significance, can you justify company's claim? </p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<h3>Determine Hypotheses</h3>

<p><b>Null hypothesis $ H_0 $ </b> -  The proportion of mid-fielders, defenders, and forwards is 30%, 60% and 10%, respectively.</p>

<p><b>Alternative hypothesis $ H_1 $ </b> - At least one of the proportions in the null hypothesis is false.</p>

<h3>Determine Degree of Freedom</h3>

<p>The degrees of freedom, DF is equal to the number of levels (k) of the categorical variable minus 1: DF = k - 1. Here levels are 3. Thus</p>

<h3>Determine chi-square test statistic</h3>

<h3>Determine p-value</h3>

<h3>Interpret results</h3>

<p>As the P-value (0.0001) is quite less than the significance level (0.05), the null hypothesis can not be accepted. Thus company claim is invalid.</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = Total number of sets.</p>

<p>${\sum x}$ = sum of the mean of all sets.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Determine the mean of each group or set's samples. Use the following data as a sample to determine the mean and grand mean.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Compute all means</p>

<p>Step 2: Divide the total by the number of groups to determine the grand mean. In the sample, there are three groups.</p>

<title>Statistics - Hypergeometric Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Hypergeometric Distribution</h1>

<p>A hypergeometric random variable is the number of successes that result from a hypergeometric experiment. The probability distribution of a hypergeometric random variable is called a <b>hypergeometric distribution</b>.</p>

<p>Hypergeometric distribution is defined and given by the following probability function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${h(x;N,n,K) = \frac{[C(k,x)][C(N-k,n-x)]}{C(N,n)}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = items in the population</p>

<p>${k}$ = successes in the population.</p>

<p>${n}$ = items in the random sample drawn from that population.</p>

<p>${x}$ = successes in the random sample.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Suppose we randomly select 5 cards without replacement from an ordinary deck of playing cards. What is the probability of getting exactly 2 red cards (i.e., hearts or diamonds)?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>This is a hypergeometric experiment in which we know the following:</p>

<p>N = 52; since there are 52 cards in a deck.</p>

<p>k = 26; since there are 26 red cards in a deck.</p>

<p>n = 5; since we randomly select 5 cards from the deck.</p>

<p>x = 2; since 2 of the cards we select are red.</p>

<p>We plug these values into the hypergeometric formula as follows:</p>

<p>Thus, the probability of randomly selecting 2 red cards is 0.32513.</p>

<title>Statistics - Hypothesis testing</title>

<h1>Statistics - Hypothesis testing</h1>

<p>A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about a population which may or may not be true. Hypothesis testing is a set of formal procedures used by statisticians to either accept or reject statistical hypotheses. Statistical hypotheses are of two types:</p>

<p><b>Null hypothesis, ${H_0}$ </b> - represents a hypothesis of chance basis.</p>

<p><b>Alternative hypothesis, ${H_a}$ </b> -  represents a hypothesis of observations which are influenced by some non-random cause.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>suppose we wanted to check whether a coin was fair and balanced. A null hypothesis might say, that half flips will be of head and half will of tails whereas alternative hypothesis might say that flips of head and tail may be very different.</p>

<p>For example if we flipped the coin 50 times, in which 40 Heads and 10 Tails results. Using result, we need to reject the null hypothesis and would conclude, based on the evidence, that the coin was probably not fair and balanced.</p>

<h3>Hypothesis Tests</h3>

<p>Following formal process is used by statistican to determine whether to reject a null hypothesis, based on sample data. This process is called hypothesis testing and is consists of following four steps:</p>

<p><b>State the hypotheses</b> - This step involves stating both null and alternative hypotheses. The hypotheses should be stated in such a way that they are mutually exclusive. If one is true then other must be false. </p>

<p><b>Formulate an analysis plan</b> - The analysis plan is to describe how to use the sample data to evaluate the null hypothesis. The evaluation process focuses around a single test statistic.</p>

<p><b>Analyze sample data</b> - Find the value of the test statistic (using properties like mean score, proportion, t statistic, z-score, etc.) stated in the analysis plan.</p>

<title>Statistics - Interval Estimation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Interval Estimation</h1>

<p>Interval estimation is the use of sample data to calculate an interval of possible (or probable) values of an unknown population parameter, in contrast to point estimation, which is a single number.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${\mu = \bar x \pm Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${\bar x}$ = mean</p>

<p>${Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}}$ = the confidence coefficient</p>

<p>${\alpha}$ = confidence level</p>

<p>${\sigma}$ = standard deviation</p>

<p>${n}$ = sample size</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Suppose a student measuring the boiling temperature of a certain liquid observes the readings (in degrees Celsius) 102.5, 101.7, 103.1, 100.9, 100.5, and 102.2 on 6 different samples of the liquid. He calculates the sample mean to be 101.82. If he knows that the standard deviation for this procedure is 1.2 degrees, what is the interval estimation for the population mean at a 95% confidence level?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>The student calculated the sample mean of the boiling temperatures to be 101.82, with standard deviation ${\sigma = 0.49}$. The critical value for a 95% confidence interval is 1.96, where ${\frac{1-0.95}{2} = 0.025}$. A 95% confidence interval for the unknown mean.</p>

<p>As the level of confidence decreases, the size of the corresponding interval will decrease. Suppose the student was interested in a 90% confidence interval for the boiling temperature. In this case, ${\sigma = 0.90}$, and ${\frac{1-0.90}{2} = 0.05}$. The critical value for this level is equal to 1.645, so the 90% confidence interval is</p>

<p>An increase in sample size will decrease the length of the confidence interval without reducing the level of confidence. This is because the standard deviation decreases as n increases.</p>

<h2>Margin of Error</h2>

<p>The margin of error ${m}$ of interval estimation is defined to be the value added or subtracted from the sample mean which determines the length of the interval:</p>

<p>${Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}}$</p>

<p>To achieve 95% interval estimation for the mean boiling point with total length less than 1 degree, the student will have to take 23 measurements.</p>

<title>Statistics - Kolmogorov Smirnov Test</title>

<h1>Statistics - Kolmogorov Smirnov Test</h1>

<p>This test is used in situations where a comparison has to be made between an observed sample distribution and theoretical distribution.</p>

<h2>K-S One Sample Test</h2>

<p>This test is used as a test of goodness of fit and is ideal when the size of the sample is small. It compares the cumulative distribution function for a variable with a specified distribution. The null hypothesis assumes no difference between the observed and theoretical distribution and the value of test statistic 'D' is calculated as:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>$D = Maximum |F_o(X)-F_r(X)|$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${F_o(X)}$ = Observed cumulative frequency distribution of a random sample of n observations.</p>

<p>and ${F_o(X) = \frac{k}{n}}$ = (No.of observations &le; X)/(Total no.of observations).</p>

<p>${F_r(X)}$ = The theoretical frequency distribution.</p>

<p>The critical value of ${D}$ is found from the K-S table values for one sample test.</p>

<p><b>Acceptance Criteria:</b> If calculated value is less than critical value accept null hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Rejection Criteria:</b> If calculated value is greater than table value reject null hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>In a study done from various streams of a college 60 students, with equal number of students drawn from each stream, are we interviewed and their intention to join the Drama Club of college was noted.</p>

<p>It was expected that 12 students from each class would join the Drama Club. Using the K-S test to find if there is any difference among student classes with regard to their intention of joining the Drama Club.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>${H_o}$: There is no difference among students of different streams with respect to their intention of joining the drama club.</p>

<p>We develop the cumulative frequencies for observed and theoretical distributions.</p>

<p>Test statistic ${|D|}$ is calculated as:</p>

<p>The table value of D at 5% significance level is given by</p>

<p>Since the calculated value is greater than the critical value, hence we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a difference among students of different streams in their intention of joining the Club.</p>

<h2>K-S Two Sample Test</h2>

<p>When instead of one, there are two independent samples then K-S two sample test can be used to test the agreement between two cumulative distributions. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the two distributions. The D-statistic is calculated in the same manner as the K-S One Sample Test.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${D = Maximum |{F_n}_1(X)-{F_n}_2(X)|}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${n_1}$ = Observations from first sample.</p>

<p>${n_2}$ = Observations from second sample.</p>

<p>It has been seen that when the cumulative distributions show large maximum deviation ${|D|}$ it is indicating towards a difference between the two sample distributions.</p>

<p>The critical value of D for samples where ${n_1 = n_2}$ and is &le; 40, the K-S table for two sample case is used. When ${n_1}$ and/or ${n_2}$ &gt; 40 then the K-S table for large samples of two sample test should be used. The null hypothesis is accepted if the calculated value is less than the table value and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Thus use of any of these nonparametric tests helps a researcher to test the significance of his results when the characteristics of the target population are unknown or no assumptions had been made about them.</p>

<title>Statistics - Kurtosis</title>

<h1>Statistics - Kurtosis</h1>

<p>The degree of flatness or peakedness is measured by kurtosis. It tells us about the extent to which the distribution is flat or peak vis-a-vis the normal curve. Diagrammatically, shows the shape of three different types of curves.</p>

<p>The normal curve is called Mesokurtic curve. If the curve of a distribution is more peaked than a normal or mesokurtic curve then it is referred to as a Leptokurtic curve. If a curve is less peaked than a normal curve, it is called as a platykurtic curve. Kurtosis is measured by moments and is given by the following formula:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${\beta_2 = \frac{\mu_4}{\mu_2}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${\mu_4 = \frac{\sum(x- \bar x)^4}{N}}$</p>

<p>The greater the value of \beta_2 the more peaked or leptokurtic the curve. A normal curve has a value of 3, a leptokurtic has \beta_2 greater than 3 and platykurtic has \beta_2 less then 3.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>The data on daily wages of 45 workers of a factory are given. Compute \beta_1 and \beta_2 using moment about the mean. Comment on the results.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Since the deviations have been taken from an assumed mean, hence we first calculate moments about arbitrary origin and then moments about mean. Moments about arbitrary origin '170'</p>

<h2>Moments about mean</h2>

<p>From the value of movement about mean, we can now calculate ${\beta_1}$ and ${\beta_2}$:</p>

<p>From the above calculations, it can be concluded that ${\beta_1}$, which measures skewness is almost zero, thereby indicating that the distribution is almost symmetrical. ${\beta_2}$ Which measures kurtosis, has a value greater than 3, thus implying that the distribution is leptokurtic.</p>

<title>Statistics - Linear regression</title>

<h1>Statistics - Linear regression</h1>

<p>Once the degree of relationship between variables has been established using co-relation analysis, it is natural to delve into the nature of relationship. Regression analysis helps in determining the cause and effect relationship between variables. It is possible to predict the value of other variables (called dependent variable) if the values of independent variables can be predicted using a graphical method or the algebraic method.</p>

<h2>Graphical Method</h2>

<p>It involves drawing a scatter diagram with independent variable on X-axis and dependent variable on Y-axis. After that a line is drawn in such a manner that it passes through most of the distribution, with remaining points distributed almost evenly on either side of the line.</p>

<p>A regression line is known as the line of best fit that summarizes the general movement of data. It shows the best mean values of one variable corresponding to mean values of the other. The regression line is based on the criteria that it is a straight line that minimizes the sum of squared deviations between the predicted and observed values of the dependent variable.</p>

<h2>Algebraic Method</h2>

<p>Algebraic method develops two regression equations of X on Y, and Y on X.</p>

<h3>Regression equation of Y on X</h3>

<p>${Y = a+bX}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${Y}$ = Dependent variable</p>

<p>${X}$ = Independent variable</p>

<p>${a}$ = Constant showing Y-intercept</p>

<p>${b}$ = Constant showing slope of line</p>

<p>Values of a and b is obtained by the following normal equations:</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = Number of observations</p>

<h3>Regression equation of X on Y</h3>

<p>${X = a+bY}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${X}$ = Dependent variable</p>

<p>${Y}$ = Independent variable</p>

<p>${a}$ = Constant showing Y-intercept</p>

<p>${b}$ = Constant showing slope of line</p>

<p>Values of a and b is obtained by the following normal equations:</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = Number of observations</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A researcher has found that there is a co-relation between the weight tendencies of father and son. He is now interested in developing regression equation on two variables from the given data:</p>

<p>Develop</p>

<p>Regression equation of Y on X.</p>

<p>Regression equation of on Y.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<h2>Regression equation of Y on X</h2>

<p>Y = a+bX</p>

<p>Where , a and b are obtained by normal equations</p>

<p>${\Rightarrow}$ 810 = 12a + 800b ... (i)</p>

<p>${\Rightarrow}$ 54049 = 800a + 53402 b ... (ii)</p>

<p>Multiplying equation (i) with 800 and equation (ii) with 12, we get:</p>

<p>96000 a + 640000 b = 648000 ... (iii)</p>

<p>96000 a + 640824 b = 648588 ... (iv)</p>

<p>Subtracting equation (iv) from (iii)</p>

<p>-824 b = -588</p>

<p>${\Rightarrow}$ b = -.0713</p>

<p>Substituting the value of b in eq. (i)</p>

<p>810 = 12a + 800 (-0.713)</p>

<p>810 = 12a + 570.4</p>

<p>12a = 239.6</p>

<p>${\Rightarrow}$ a = 19.96</p>

<p>Hence the equation Y on X can be written as </p>

<h2>Regression equation of Y on X</h2>

<title>Statistics - Logistic Regression</title>

<h1>Statistics - Logistic Regression</h1>

<p>Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${\pi(x) = \frac{e^{\alpha + \beta x}}{1 + e^{\alpha + \beta x}}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>Response - Presence/Absence of characteristic.</p>

<p>Predictor - Numeric variable observed for each case</p>

<p>${\beta = 0 \Rightarrow }$ P (Presence) is the same at each level of x.</p>

<p>${\beta \gt 0 \Rightarrow }$ P (Presence) increases as x increases</p>

<p>${\beta = 0 \Rightarrow }$ P (Presence) decreases as x increases.</p>

<title>Statistics - Mcnemar Test</title>

<h1>Statistics - Mcnemar Test</h1>

<p>Mc Nemer test is utilized for two related examples as a part of circumstances where the states of mind of individuals are noted previously, then after the fact treatment to test the essentialness of progress in sentiment if any.</p>

<p>The Mc Nemer test is especially helpful when the information speaks the truth two related samples. For the most part this information is utilized as a part of circumstances where the states of mind of individuals are noted before overseeing the treatment and are then contrasted and investigations in the wake of managing the treatment. It can along these lines be said that utilizing McNemer test we can judge if there is any adjustment in the demeanors or supposition of individuals subsequent to regulating the treatment with the utilization of table as demonstrated as follows:</p>

<p>As can be seen C and B don't change their supposition and show 'Do Not Favour' and 'Favour' individually even after the treatment has been administered .However, A which was good before treatment demonstrates a 'Do Not Favour' reaction after treatment and vice versa for D. It can hence be said that ${A+D}$ shows change in individuals' reaction.</p>

<p>The null hypothesis for McNemer test is that ${\frac{(A+D)}{2}}$ cases change in one direction and the same proportion of change takes place in other direction.</p>

<p>McNemer test statistic uses a transformed _test model as follows:</p>

<p>${x^2 = \frac{(|A-D|-1)^2}{(A+D)}}$</p>

<p>(Degree of freedom = 1.)</p>

<p><b>Acceptance Criteria:</b> If the calculated value is less then the table value, accept null hypothesis.</p>

<p><b>Rejection Criteria:</b> If the calculated value is more than table value then null hypothesis is rejected.</p>

<h2>Illustration</h2>

<p>In a before and after experiment the responses obtained from 300 respondents were classified as follows:</p>

<p>Test at 5% significance level, using McNemer test if there is any significant difference in the opinion of people after the treatment.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>${H_o}$: There is no difference in the opinion of people even after the experiment.</p>

<p>The test statistic is calculated using the formula:</p>

<p>The value of test at 5% significance level for 1 D.F. is 3.84. Since the test is greater than the table value, the null hypothesis is rejected i.e. the opinion of people has changed after the treatment.</p>

<title>Statistics - Negative Binomial Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Negative Binomial Distribution</h1>

<p>Negative binomial distribution is a probability distribution of number of occurences of successes and failures in a sequence of independent trails before a specific number of success occurs. Following are the key points to be noted about a negative binomial experiment.</p>

<p>The experiment should be of x repeated trials.</p>

<p>Each trail have two possible outcome, one for success, another for failure.</p>

<p>Probability of success is same on every trial.</p>

<p>Output of one trial is independent of output of another trail.</p>

<p>Experiment should be carried out until r successes are observed, where r is mentioned beforehand.</p>

<p>Negative binomial distribution probability can be computed using following:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${ f(x; r, P) = ^{x-1}C_{r-1} \times P^r \times (1-P)^{x-r}  }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${x}$ = Total number of trials.</p>

<p>${r}$ = Number of occurences of success.</p>

<p>${P}$ = Probability of success on each occurence.</p>

<p>${1-P}$ = Probability of failure on each occurence.</p>

<p>${f(x; r, P)}$ = Negative binomial probability, the probability that an x-trial negative binomial experiment results in the rth success on the xth trial, when the probability of success on each trial is P.</p>

<p>${^{n}C_{r}}$ = Combination of n items taken r at a time.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Robert is a football player. His success rate of goal hitting is 70%. What is the probability that Robert hits his third goal on his fifth attempt?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Here probability of success, P is 0.70. Number of trials, x is 5 and number of successes, r is 3. Using negative binomial distribution formula, let's compute the probability of hitting third goal in fifth attempt.</p>

<title>Statistics - Normal Distribution</title>

<h1>Statistics - Normal Distribution</h1>

<p>A normal distribution is an arrangement of a data set in which most values cluster in the middle of the range and the rest taper off symmetrically toward either extreme. Height is one simple example of something that follows a normal distribution pattern: Most people are of average height</td><td> the numbers of people that are taller and shorter than average are fairly equal and a very small (and still roughly equivalent) number of people are either extremely tall or extremely short.Here's an example of a normal distribution curve:</p>

<p>A graphical representation of a normal distribution is sometimes called a bell curve because of its flared shape. The precise shape can vary according to the distribution of the population but the peak is always in the middle and the curve is always symmetrical. In a normal distribution</td><td> the mean</td><td> mode and median are all the same.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${y = \frac{1}{\sqrt {2 \pi}}e^{\frac{-(x - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma}} }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${\mu}$ = Mean</p>

<p>${\sigma}$ = Standard Deviation</p>

<p>${\pi \approx 3.14159}$ </p>

<p>${e \approx 2.71828}$ </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A survey of daily travel time had these results (in minutes):</p>

<p>The Mean is 38.8 minutes, and the Standard Deviation is 11.4 minutes. Convert the values to z - scores and prepare the Normal Distribution Graph.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>The formula for z-score that we have been using:</p>

<p>${z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${z}$ = the "z-score" (Standard Score)</p>

<p>${x}$ = the value to be standardized</p>

<p>${\mu}$ = mean</p>

<p>${\sigma}$ = the standard deviation</p>

<p>To convert 26:</p>

<p>First subtract the mean: 26-38.8 = -12.8,</p>

<p>Then divide by the Standard Deviation: -12.8/11.4 = -1.12</p>

<p>So 26 is -1.12 Standard Deviation from the Mean</p>

<p>Here are the first three conversions.</p>

<p>A survey claims that 9 out of 10 doctors recommend aspirin for their patients with headaches. To test this claim, a random sample of 100 doctors is obtained. Of these 100 doctors, 82 indicate that they recommend aspirin. Is this claim accurate? Use alpha = 0.05.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Define Null and Alternative Hypotheses</p>

<p>Here Alpha = 0.05. Using an alpha of 0.05 with a two-tailed test, we would expect our distribution to look something like this:</p>

<p>Here we have 0.025 in each tail. Looking up 1 - 0.025 in our z-table, we find a critical value of 1.96. Thus, our decision rule for this two-tailed test is: If Z is less than -1.96, or greater than 1.96, reject the null hypothesis.Calculate Test Statistic:</p>

<p>As z = -2.667 Thus as result we should reject the null hypothesis and as conclusion, The claim that 9 out of 10 doctors recommend aspirin for their patients is not accurate, z = -2.667, p &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Statistics - Power Calculator</title>

<h1>Statistics - Power Calculator</h1>

<p>$ {Power = \ P(\ reject\ H_0 | H_1 \ is \ true) } $</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>A survey has been conducted on students to check their IQ level. Suppose a random sample of 16 students is tested. The surveyor tests the null hypothesis that the IQ of student is 100 against the alternative hypothesis that the IQ of student is not 100, using a 0.05 level of significance and standard deviation of 16. What is the power of the hypothesis test if the true population mean were 116?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>As distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis follows a Student t-distribution. Here n is large, we can approximate the t-distribution by a normal distribution. As probability of committing Type I error($ { \alpha } $) is 0.05 , we can reject the null hypothesis ${H_0}$ when the test statistic $ { T \ge 1.645 } $. Let's compute the value of sample mean using test statistics by following formula.</p>

<p>Let's compute the power of statistical test by following formula.</p>

<p>So we have a 99.09% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis ${H_0: \mu = 100 } $ in favor of the alternative hypothesis $ {H_1: \mu \gt 100 } $ where unknown population mean is $ {\mu = 116 } $. </p>

<title>Statistics - Probability</title>

<h1>Statistics - Probability</h1>

<h2>Probability</h2>

<p>Probability implies 'likelihood' or 'chance'. When an event is certain to happen then the probability of occurrence of that event is 1 and when it is certain that the event cannot happen then the probability of that event is 0.</p>

<p>Hence the value of probability ranges from 0 to 1. Probability has been defined in a varied manner by various schools of thought. Some of which are discussed below.</p>

<h2>Classical Definition of Probability</h2>

<p>As the name suggests the classical approach to defining probability is the oldest approach. It states that if there are n exhaustive, mutually exclusive andequally likely cases out of which m cases are favourable to the happening ofevent A, </p>

<p>Then the probabilities of event A is defined as given by the following probability function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>Thus to calculate the probability we need information on number of favorable cases and total number of equally likely cases. This can he explained using following example.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A coin is tossed. What is the probability of getting a head?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Total number of equally likely outcomes (n) = 2 (i.e. head or tail)</p>

<p>Number of outcomes favorable to head (m) = 1</p>

<title>Statistics - Probability Additive Theorem</title>

<h1>Statistics - Probability Additive Theorem</h1>

<h2>For Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>

<p>The additive theorem of probability states if A and B are two mutually exclusive events then the probability of either A or B is given by</p>

<p>The theorem can he extended to three mutually exclusive events also as</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A card is drawn from a pack of 52, what is the probability that it is a king or a queen?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Let Event (A) = Draw of a card of king</p>

<p>Event (B) Draw of a card of queen</p>

<p>P (card draw is king or queen) = P (card is king) + P (card is queen)</p>

<h2>For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events</h2>

<p>In case there is a possibility of both events to occur then the additive theorem is written as:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A shooter is known to hit a target 3 out of 7 shots; whet another shooter is known to hit the target 2 out of 5 shots. Find the probability of the target being hit at all when both of them try.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Probability of first shooter hitting the target P (A) = ${\frac{3}{7}}$</p>

<p>Probability of second shooter hitting the target P (B) = ${\frac{2}{5}}$</p>

<p>Event A and B are not mutually exclusive as both the shooters may hit target. Hence the additive rule applicable is</p>

<title>Statistics - Probability Multiplicative Theorem</title>

<h1>Statistics - Probability Multiplicative Theorem</h1>

<h2>For Independent Events</h2>

<p>The theorem states that the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of two events that are independent is given by the product of their individual probabilities.</p>

<p>The theorem can he extended to three or more independent events also as</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A college has to appoint a lecturer who must be B.Com., MBA, and Ph. D, the probability of which is ${\frac{1}{20}}$, ${\frac{1}{25}}$, and ${\frac{1}{40}}$ respectively. Find the probability of getting such a person to be appointed by the college.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Probability of a person being a B.Com.P(A) =${\frac{1}{20}}$ </p>

<p>Probability of a person being a MBA P(B) = ${\frac{1}{25}}$ </p>

<p>Probability of a person being a Ph.D P(C) =${\frac{1}{40}}$ </p>

<p>Using multiplicative theorem for independent events</p>

<h2>For Dependent Events (Conditional Probability)</h2>

<p>As defined earlier, dependent events are those were the occurrences or nonoccurrence of one event effects the outcome of next event. For such events the earlier stated multiplicative theorem is not applicable. The probability associated with such events is called as conditional probability and is given by</p>

<p>P(A/B) = ${\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}}$ or ${\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}}$</p>

<p>Read P(A/B) as the probability of occurrence of event A when event B has already occurred.</p>

<p>Similarly the conditional probability of B given A is</p>

<p>P(B/A) = ${\frac{P(AB)}{P(A)}}$ or ${\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}}$</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A coin is tossed 2 times. The toss resulted in one head and one tail. What is the probability that the first throw resulted in a tail?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>The sample space of a coin tossed two times is given as S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} </p>

<p>Let Event A be the first throw resulting in a tail. </p>

<p>Event B be that one tail and one head occurred.</p>

<title>Statistics - Probability Bayes Theorem</title>

<h1>Statistics - Probability Bayes Theorem</h1>

<p>One of the most significant developments in the probability field has been the development of Bayesian decision theory which has proved to be of immense help in making decisions under uncertain conditions. The Bayes Theorem was developed by a British Mathematician Rev. Thomas Bayes. The probability given under Bayes theorem is also known by the name of inverse probability, posterior probability or revised probability. This theorem finds the probability of an event by considering the given sample information; hence the name posterior probability. The bayes theorem is based on the formula of conditional probability.</p>

<p>conditional probability of event ${A_1}$ given event ${B}$ is</p>

<p>Similarly probability of event ${A_1}$ given event ${B}$ is</p>

<p>Where</p>

<p>Hence the general form of Bayes Theorem is</p>

<p>	Where ${A_1}$, ${A_2}$...${A_i}$...${A_n}$ are set of n mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.</p>

<title>Statistics - Quadratic Regression Equation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Quadratic Regression Equation</h1>

<p>Quadratic regression is deployed to figure out an equation of the parabola which can best fit the given set of data. It is of following form:</p>

<p>${ y = ax^2 + bx + c \ where \ a \ne 0}$</p>

<p>Least square method can be used to find out the Quadratic Regression Equation. In this method, we find out the value of a, b and c so that squared vertical distance between each given point (${x_i, y_i}$) and the parabola equation (${ y = ax^2 + bx + 2}$) is minimal. The matrix equation for the parabolic curve is given by:</p>

<h2>Correlation Coefficient, r</h2>

<p>Correlation coefficient, r determines how good a quardratic equation can fit the given data. If r is close to 1 then it is good fit. r can be computed by following formula.</p>

<p>Generally, quadratic regression calculators are used to compute the quadratic regression equation.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Compute the quadratic regression equation of following data. Check its best fitness.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Compute a quadratic regression on calculator by putting the x and y values. The best fit quadratic equation for above points comes as</p>

<p>${ y = 1.1071x^2 + 0.5714x }$</p>

<p>To check the best fitness, plot the graph.</p>

<p>So the value of Correlation Coefficient, r for the data is 0.99420 and is close to 1. Hence quadratic regression equation is best fit.</p>

<title>Statistics - Qualitative Data Vs Quantitative Data</title>

<h1>Statistics - Qualitative Data Vs Quantitative Data</h1>

<h2>Qualitative Data</h2>

<p>Qualitative data is a set of information which can not be measured using numbers. It generally consist of words, subjective narratives. Result of an qualitative data analysis can come in form of highlighting key words, extracting information and concepts elaboration. For example, a study on parents perception about the current education system for their kids. The resulted information collected from them might be in narrative form and you need to deduce the analysis that they are satisfied, un-satisfied or need improvement in certain areas and so on.</p>

<h3>Strengh</h3>

<p><b>Better understanding</b> - Qualitative data gives a better understanding of the perspectives and needs of participants.</p>

<p><b>Provides Explaination</b> - Qualitative data along with quantitative data can explain the result of the survey and can measure the correction of the quantitative data.</p>

<p><b>Better Identification of behavior patterns</b> - Qualitative data can provide detailed information which can prove itself useful in identification of behaviorial patterns.</p>

<h3>Weakness</h3>

<p><b>Lesser reachability</b> - Being subjective in nature, small population is generally covered to represent the large population.</p>

<p><b>Time Consuming</b> - Qualitative data is time consuming as large data is to be understood. </p>

<p><b>Possiblity of Bias</b> - Being subjective analysis; evaluator bias is quite feasible.</p>

<h2>Quantitative Data</h2>

<p>Quantitative data is a set of numbers collected from a group of people and involves statistical analysis.For example if you conduct a satisfaction survey from participants and ask them to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5. You can collect the ratings and being numerical in nature, you will use statistical techniques to draw conclusions about participants satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Strengh</h3>

<h3>Weakness</h3>

<p><b>Limited Options</b> - Respondents are required to choose from limited options.</p>

<p><b>High Complexity</b> - Qualitative data may need complex procedures to get correct sample. </p>

<p><b>Require Expertise</b> - Analysis of qualitative data requires certain expertise in statistical analysis.</p>

<title>Statistics - Quartile Deviation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Quartile Deviation</h1>

<p>It depends on the lower quartile ${Q_1}$ and the upper quartile ${Q_3}$. The difference ${Q_3 - Q_1}$ is called the inter quartile range. The difference ${Q_3 - Q_1}$ divided by 2 is called semi-inter quartile range or the quartile deviation.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${Q.D. = \frac{Q_3 - Q_1}{2}}$</p>

<h2>Coefficient of Quartile Deviation</h2>

<p>A relative measure of dispersion based on the quartile deviation is known as the coefficient of quartile deviation. It is characterized as</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Calculate the quartile deviation and coefficient of quartile deviation from the data given below:</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<h3>${Q_1}$</h3>

<p>Value of ${\frac{n}{4}^{th}}$ item =Value of ${\frac{60}{4}^{th}}$ thing = ${15^{th}}$ item. Thus ${Q_1}$ lies in class 10.25-10.75.</p>

<h3>${Q_3}$</h3>

<p>Value of ${\frac{3n}{4}^{th}}$ item =Value of ${\frac{3 \times 60}{4}^{th}}$ thing = ${45^{th}}$ item. Thus ${Q_3}$ lies in class 11.25-11.75.</p>

<title>Statistics - Range Rule of Thumb</title>

<h1>Statistics - Range Rule of Thumb</h1>

<p><b>The Range Rule of Thumb</b> says that the range is about four times the standard deviation. The standard deviation is another measure of spread in statistics. It tells you how your data is clustered around the mean.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${s \approx \frac{R}{4}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${s}$ = standard deviation.</p>

<p>${R}$ = Maximum - Minimum of a range.</p>

<p>How the range rule works, we will look at the following example.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Given the following values: 12, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 18, 20, 20, and 25. Calculate standard deviation using range rule of thumb.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>These values have mean of 17. we first calculate the range of our data as 25 - 12 = 13, and then divide this number by four we have our estimate of the standard deviation as ${\frac{13}{4} = 3.25}$. This number is relatively close to the true standard deviation, and good for a rough estimate.</p>

<title>Statistics - Required Sample Size</title>

<h1>Statistics - Required Sample Size</h1>

<p>A critical part of testing is the choice of the measure of test i.e. the quantity of units to be chosen from the populace for completing the exploration. There is no unequivocal answer or answer for characterizing the most suitable size. There are sure misguided judgments with respect to the span of test like the example ought to be 10% of the populace or the specimen size is relative to the extent of the universe. However as said before, these are just misguided judgments. How extensive a specimen ought to be is capacity of the variety in the populace parameters under study and the assessing exactness required by the specialist.</p>

<p>The decision on optimum size of the sample can be approached from two angles viz. the subjective and mathematical.</p>

<p>Subjective Approach to Determining Sample Size</p>

<p>Mathematical Approach to Sample Size Determination</p>

<h2>Subjective Approach to Determining Sample Size</h2>

<p>The choice of the size of sample is affected by various factors discussed as below:</p>

<p><b>The Nature of Population</b> - The level of homogeneity or heterogeneity influences the extent of a specimen. On the off chance that the populace is homogeneous concerning the qualities of interest then even a little size of the specimen is adequate. However in the event that the populace is heterogeneous then a bigger example would be required to guarantee sufficient representativeness.</p>

<p><b>Nature of Respondent</b> - If the respondents are effortlessly accessible and available then required data can be got from a little example. On the off chance that, notwithstanding, the respondents are uncooperative and non-reaction is relied upon to be high then a bigger specimen is required.</p>

<p><b>Nature of Study</b> - A onetime study can be led utilizing a substantial example. If there should be an occurrence of examination studies which are of constant nature and are to be seriously completed, a little specimen is more suitable as it is anything but difficult to oversee and hold a little example over a long compass of time.</p>

<p><b>Sampling Technique Used</b> - An essential variable affecting the span of test is the examining system received. Firstly a non-likelihood system requires a bigger specimen than a likelihood strategy. Besides inside of likelihood testing, if straightforward irregular examining is utilized it requires a bigger example than if stratification is utilized, where a little specimen is adequate.</p>

<p><b>Complexity of Tabulation</b> - While settling on the specimen estimate the specialist ought to likewise consider the quantity of classifications and classes into which the discoveries are to be assembled and broke down. It has been seen that more the quantity of classifications that are to be produced the bigger is the example size. Since every class ought to be enough spoken to, a bigger specimen is required to give solid measures of the littlest classification.</p>

<p><b>Availability of Resources</b> - The assets and the time accessible to specialist impact the span of test. Examination is a period and cash escalated assignment, with exercises like readiness of instrument, contracting and preparing field staff, transportation costs and so forth taking up a considerable measure of assets. Subsequently if the scientist does not have enough time and supports accessible he will settle on a littler example.</p>

<p><b>Degree of Precision and Accuracy Required</b> - . It has turned out to be clear from our prior discourse that accuracy, which is measured by standard blunder, wills high just if S.E is less or the example size is substantial.</p>

<p>Also to get a high level of precision a bigger specimen is required. Other then these subjective efforts, sample size can be determined mathematically also.</p>

<h2>Mathematical Approach to Sample Size Determination</h2>

<p>In the mathematical approach to sample size determination the precision of estimate required is stated first and then the sample size is worked out. The precision can be specified as ${\pm}$ 1 of the true mean with 99% confidence level. This means that if the sample mean is 200, then the true value of the mean will be between 199 and 201. This level of precision is denoted by the term 'c'</p>

<h3>Sample Size determination for means.</h3>

<p>The confidence interval for the universe mean is given by</p>

<p>${\bar x \pm Z\frac{\sigma_p}{\sqrt N}\ or\ \bar x \pm e}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${\bar x}$ = Sample mean</p>

<p>${e}$ = Acceptable error</p>

<p>${Z}$ = Value of standard normal variate at a given confidence level</p>

<p>${\sigma_p}$ = Standard deviation of the population</p>

<p>${n}$ = Size of the sample</p>

<p>The acceptable error 'e' i.e. the difference between ${\mu}$ and ${\bar x}$ is given by</p>

<p>${Z.\frac{\sigma_p}{\sqrt N}}$</p>

<p>${n = \frac{Z^2{\sigma_p}^2}{e^2}}$</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>In case the sample size is significant visa-a-vis the population size then above formula will be corrected by the finite population multiplier.</p>

<p>${n = \frac{Z^2.N.{\sigma_p}^2}{(N-1)e^2 + Z^2.{\sigma_p}^2}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${N}$ = size of the population</p>

<h3>Sample Size Determination for Proportions</h3>

<p>The method for determining the sample size when estimating a proportion remains the same as the method for estimating the mean. The confidence interval for universe proportion ${\hat p}$ is given by</p>

<p>${ p \pm Z. \sqrt{\frac{p.q}{n}}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${p}$ = sample proportion</p>

<p>${q = (1 - p)}$</p>

<p>${Z}$ = Value of standard normal variate for a sample proportion</p>

<p>${n}$ = Size of the sample</p>

<p>Since ${ \hat p}$ is to be estimated hence the value of p can be determined by taking the value of p = 0.5, an acceptable value, giving a conservative sample size. The other option is that the value of p is estimated either through a pilot study or on a personal judgement basis. Given the value of p, the acceptable error 'e' is given by</p>

<p>In case the population is finite then the above formula will be corrected by the finite population multiplier.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A shopping store is interested in estimating the proportion of households possessing the store Privilege Membership card. Previous studies have shown that 59% of the household had a store credit card. At 95% confidence level with a tolerable error level of 05.</p>

<p>Determine the sample size required to conduct the study.</li></p>

<p>What would be the sample size if the number of target households is known to be 1000?</li></p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>The store has the following information</p>

<p>The sample size can be determined by applying the following formula:</p>

<p>Hence a sample of 369 households is sufficient to conduct the study.</p>

<p>Since the population i.e. target households are known to be 1000 and the above sample is a significant proportion of total population hence the corrected formula which includes finite population multiplier is used.</p>

<p>Thus if the population is a finite one with 1000 households then the sample size required to conduct the study is 270.</p>

<p>It is evident from this illustration that if the population size is known then the sample size determined has decreased in size.</p>

<title>Statistics - Residual analysis</title>

<h1>Statistics - Residual analysis</h1>

<p>Residual analysis is used to assess the appropriateness of a linear regression model by defining residuals and examining the residual plot graphs.</p>

<h2>Residual</h2>

<p>Residual($ e $) refers to the difference between observed value($ y $) vs predicted value ($ \hat y $). Every data point have one residual.</p>

<h2>Residual Plot</h2>

<p>A residual plot is a graph in which residuals are on tthe vertical axis and the independent variable is on the horizontal axis. If the dots are randomly dispersed around the horizontal axis then a linear regression model is appropriate for the data; otherwise, choose a non-linear model.</p>

<h2>Types of Residual Plot</h2>

<p>Following example shows few patterns in residual plots.</p>

<p>In first case, dots are randomly dispersed. So linear regression model is preferred. In Second and third case, dots are non-randomly dispersed and suggests that a non-linear regression method is preferred.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Check where a linear regression model is appropriate for the following data.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> Compute residuals for each data point.</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> - Draw the residual plot graph.</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b> - Check the randomness of the residuals.</p>

<p>Here residual plot exibits a random pattern - First residual is positive, following two are negative, the fourth one is positive, and the last residual is negative. As pattern is quite random which indicates that a linear regression model is appropriate for the above data.</p>

<title>Statistics - Sample Planning</title>

<h1>Statistics - Sample Planning</h1>

<p>Sample planning refers to a detailed outline of measurements to be taken:</p>

<p><b>At what time</b> - Decide the time when a survey is to be conducted. For example, taking people views on newspaper outreach before launch of a new newspaper in the area.</p>

<p><b>On Which material</b> - Decide the material on which the survey is to be conducted. It could be a online poll or paper based checklist.</p>

<p><b>In what manner</b> - Decide the sampling methods which will be used to choose people on whom the survey is to be conducted.</p>

<p><b>By whom</b> - Decide the person(s) who has to collect the observations.</p>

<p>Sampling plans should be prepared in such a way that the result correctly represent the representative sample of interest and allows all questions to be answered.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>Following are the steps involved in sample planning.</p>

<p><b>Identification of parameters</b> - Identify the attributes/ parameters to be measured. Identify the ranges, possible values and required resolution.</b></p>

<title>Statistics - Sampling methods</title>

<h1>Statistics - Sampling methods</h1>

<p>Sampling methods are the ways to choose people from the population to be considered in a sample survey. Samples can be divided based on following criteria.</p>

<p><b>Probability samples</b> - In such samples, each population element has a known probability or chance of being chosen for the sample.</p>

<p><b>Non-probability samples</b> -  In such samples, one can not be assured of having known probility of each population element.</p>

<h2>Probability sampling methods</h2>

<p>Probability sampling methods ensures that the sample choosen represent the population correctly and the survey conducted will be statistically valid. Following are the types of probability sampling methods:</p>

<p><b>Simple random sampling.</b> - This method refers to a method having following properties:</p>

<p>The population have N objects.</p>

<p>The sample have n objects.</p>

<p>All possible samples of n objects have equal probability of occurence.</p>

<p><b>Stratified sampling</b> - In this type of sampling method, population is divided into groups called strata based on certain common characteristic like geography. Then samples are selected from each group using simple random sampling method and then survey is conducted on people of those samples.</p>

<p><b>Cluster sampling</b> - In this type of sampling method, each population member is assigned to a unique group called cluster. A sample cluster is selected using simple random sampling method and then survey is conducted on people of that sample cluster.</p>

<p><b>Multistage sampling</b> - In such case, combination of different sampling methods at different stages. For example, at first stage, cluster sampling can be used to choose clusters from population and then sample random sampling can be used to choose elements from each cluster for the final sample.</p>

<p><b>Systematic random sampling</b> - In this type of sampling method, a list of every member of population is created and then first sample element is randomly selected from first k elements. Thereafter, every kth element is selected from the list.</p>

<h2>Non-probability sampling methods</h2>

<p>Non-probability sampling methods are convenient and cost-savvy. But they do not allow to estimate the extent to which sample statistics are likely to vary from population parameters. Whereas probability sampling methods allows that kind of analysis. Following are the types of non-probability sampling methods:</p>

<p><b>Voluntary sample</b> - In such sampling methods, interested people are asked to get involved in a voluntary survey. A good example of voluntary sample in on-line poll of a news show where viewers are asked to participate. In voluntary sample, viewers choose the sample, not the one who conducts survey.</p>

<p><b>Convenience sample</b> - In such sampling methods, surveyor picks people who are easily available to give their inputs. For example, a surveyer chooses a cinema hall to survey movie viewers. If the cinema hall was selected on the basis that it was easier to reach then it is a convenience sampling method.</p>

<title>Statistics - Scatterplots</title>

<h1>Statistics - Scatterplots</h1>

<p>A scatterplot is a graphical way to display the relationship between two quantitative sample variables. It consists of an X axis, a Y axis and a series of dots where each dot represents one observation from a data set. The position of the dot refers to its X and Y values.</p>

<h2>Patterns of Data in Scatterplots</h2>

<p>Scatterplots are used to analyze patterns which generally varies on the basis of linearity, slope, and strength.</p>

<p><b>Linearity</b> -  data pattern is either linear/straight or nonlinear/curved.</p>

<p><b>Slope</b> - direction of change in variable Y with respect to increase in value of variable X. If Y increases with increase in X, slope is positive otherwise slope is negative.</p>

<p><b>Strength</b> - Degree of spreadness of scatter in the plot. If dots are widely dispersed, the relationship is consider weak. If dot are densed around a line then the relationship is said to be strong.</p>

<title>Statistics - Shannon Wiener Diversity Index</title>

<h1>Statistics - Shannon Wiener Diversity Index</h1>

<p>In the literature, the terms species richness and species diversity are sometimes used interchangeably. We suggest that at the very least, authors should define what they mean by either term. Of the many species diversity indices used in the literature, the Shannon Index is perhaps most commonly used. On some occasions it is called the Shannon-Wiener Index and on other occasions it is called the Shannon-Weaver Index. We suggest an explanation for this dual use of terms and in so doing we offer a tribute to the late Claude Shannon (who passed away on 24 February 2001).</p>

<p>Shannon-Wiener Index is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${p_i}$ = proportion of total sample represented by species ${i}$. Divide no. of individuals of species i by total number of samples.</p>

<p>${S}$ = number of species, = species richness</p>

<p>${H_{max} = ln(S)}$ = Maximum diversity possible</p>

<p>${E}$ = Evenness = ${\frac{H}{H_{max}}}$ </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>The samples of 5 species are 60,10,25,1,4. Calculate the Shannon diversity index and Evenness for these sample values.</p>

<p>Sample Values (S) = 60,10,25,1,4 number of species (N) = 5</p>

<p>First, let us calculate the sum of the given values.</p>

<p>sum	= (60+10+25+1+4) = 100 </p>

<title>Statistics - Signal to Noise Ratio</title>

<h1>Statistics - Signal to Noise Ratio</h1>

<p>Sign to-commotion proportion (contracted SNR) is a measure utilized as a part of science and designing that analyzes the level of a coveted sign to the level of foundation clamor. It is characterized as the proportion of sign energy to the clamor power, regularly communicated in decibels. A proportion higher than 1:1 (more prominent than 0 dB) shows more flag than clamor. While SNR is regularly cited for electrical signs, it can be connected to any type of sign, (for example, isotope levels in an ice center or biochemical motioning between cells).</p>

<p>Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the power of a signal (meaningful information) and the power of background noise (unwanted signal):</p>

<p>If the variance of the signal and noise are known, and the signal is zero:</p>

<p>If the signal and the noise are measured across the same impedance, then the SNR can be obtained by calculating the square of the amplitude ratio:</p>

<p>Where A is root mean square (RMS) amplitude (for example, RMS voltage).</p>

<h2>Decibels</h2>

<p>Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range, signals are often expressed using the logarithmic decibel scale. Based upon the definition of decibel, signal and noise may be expressed in decibels (dB) as</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>In a similar manner, SNR may be expressed in decibels as</p>

<p>Using the definition of SNR</p>

<p>Using the quotient rule for logarithms</p>

<p>Substituting the definitions of SNR, signal, and noise in decibels into the above equation results in an important formula for calculating the signal to noise ratio in decibels, when the signal and noise are also in decibels:</p>

<p>In the above formula, P is measured in units of power, such as Watts or mill watts, and signal-to-noise ratio is a pure number.</p>

<p>However, when the signal and noise are measured in Volts or Amperes, which are measures of amplitudes, they must be squared to be proportionate to power as shown below:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Compute the SNR of a 2.5 kHz sinusoid sampled at 48 kHz. Add white noise with standard deviation 0.001. Set the random number generator to the default settings for reproducible results.</p>

<title>Statistics - Simple random sampling</title>

<h1>Statistics - Simple random sampling</h1>

<p>A simple random sample is defined as one in which each element of the population has an equal and independent chance of being selected. In case of a population with N units, the probability of choosing n sample units, with all possible combinations of  N<sub>C<sub>n</sub></sub> samples is given by 1/N<sub>C<sub>n</sub></sub> e.g. If we have a population of five elements (A, B, C, D, E) i.e. N 5, and we want a sample of size n = 3, then there are 5<sub>C<sub>3</sub></sub>  = 10 possible samples and the probability of any single unit being a member of the sample is given by 1/10.</p>

<p>Simple random sampling can be done in two different ways i.e. 'with replacement' or 'without replacement'. When the units are selected into a sample successively after replacing the selected unit before the next draw, it is a simple random sample with replacement. If the units selected are not replaced before the next draw and drawing of successive units are made only from the remaining units of the population, then it is termed as simple random sample without replacement. Thus in the former method a unit once selected may be repeated, whereas in the latter a unit once selected is not repeated. Due to more statistical efficiency associated with a simple random sample without replacement it is the preferred method.</p>

<p>A simple random sample can be drawn through either of the two procedures i.e. through lottery method or through random number tables.</p>

<p><b>Lottery Method</b> - Under this method units are selected on the basis of random draws. Firstly each member or element of the population is assigned a unique number. In the next step these numbers are written on separate cards which are physically similar in shape, size, color etc. Then they are placed in a basket and thoroughly mixed. In the last step the slips are taken out randomly without looking at them. The number of slips drawn is equal to the sample size required.</p>

<p>Lottery method suffers from few drawbacks. The process of writing N number of slips is cumbersome and shuffling a large number of slips, where population size is very large, is difficult. Also human bias may enter while choosing the slips. Hence the other alternative i.e. random numbers can be used.</p>

<p><b>Random Number Tables Method</b> - These consist of columns of numbers which have been randomly prepared. Number of random tables are available e.g. Fisher and Yates Tables, Tippets random number etc. Listed below is a sequence of two digited random numbers from Fisher &amp; Yates table: </p>

<p>61, 44, 65, 22, 01, 67, 76, 23, 57, 58, 54, 11, 33, 86, 07, 26, 75, 76, 64, 22, 19, 35, 74, 49, 86, 58, 69, 52, 27, 34, 91, 25, 34, 67, 76, 73, 27, 16, 53, 18, 19, 69, 32, 52, 38, 72, 38, 64, 81, 79 and 38.</p>

<p>The first step involves assigning a unique number to each member of the population e.g. if the population comprises of 20 people then all individuals are numbered from 01 to 20. If we are to collect a sample of 5 units then referring to the random number tables 5 double digit numbers are chosen. E.g. using the above table the units having the following five numbers will form a sample:  01, 11, 07, 19 and 16. If the sampling is without replacement and a particular random number repeats itself then it will not be taken again and the next number that fits our criteria will be chosen.</p>

<p>Thus a simple random sample can be drawn using either of the two procedures. However in practice, it has been seen that simple random sample involves lots of time and effort and is impractical. </p>

<title>Statistics - Skewness</title>

<h1>Statistics - Skewness</h1>

<p>If dispersion measures amount of variation, then the direction of variation is measured by skewness. The most commonly used measure of skewness is Karl Pearson's measure given by the symbol Skp. It is a relative measure of skewness.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${S_{KP} = \frac{Mean-Mode}{Standard Deviation}}$</p>

<p>When the distribution is symmetrical then the value of coefficient of skewness is zero because the mean, median and mode coincide. If the co-efficient of skewness is a positive value then the distribution is positively skewed and when it is a negative value, then the distribution is negatively skewed. In terms of moments skewness is represented as follows:</p>

<p>If the value of ${\mu_3}$ is zero it implies symmetrical distribution. The higher the value of ${\mu_3}$, the greater is the symmetry. However ${\mu_3}$ do not tell us about the direction of skewness.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Information collected on the average strength of students of an IT course in two colleges is as follows:</p>

<p>Can we conclude that the two distributions are similar in their variation?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>A look at the information available reveals that both the colleges have equal dispersion of 30 students. However to establish if the two distributions are similar or not a more comprehensive analysis is required i.e. we need to work out a measure of skewness.</p>

<p>Value of mode is not given but it can be calculated by using the following formula:</p>

<title>Statistics - Standard Deviation</title>

<h1>Statistics - Standard Deviation</h1>

<p>Standard deviation is the square root of the average of squared deviations of the items from their mean. Symbolically it is represented by  ${\sigma}$.</p>

<p>We're going to discuss methods to compute the <b>Standard deviation</b> for three types of series:</p>

<title>Statistics - Standard Error ( SE )</title>

<h1>Statistics - Standard Error ( SE )</h1>

<p>The standard deviation of a sampling distribution is called as standard error. In sampling, the three most important characteristics are: accuracy, bias and precision. It can be said that:</p>

<p>The estimate derived from any one sample is accurate to the extent that it differs from the population parameter. Since the population parameters can only be determined by a sample survey, hence they are generally unknown and the actual difference between the sample estimate and population parameter cannot be measured.</p>

<p>The estimator is unbiased if the mean of the estimates derived from all the possible samples equals the population parameter.</p>

<p>Even if the estimator is unbiased an individual sample is most likely going to yield inaccurate estimate and as stated earlier, inaccuracy cannot be measured. However it is possible to measure the precision i.e. the range between which the true value of the population parameter is expected to lie, using the concept of standard error.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>$SE_\bar{x} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${s}$ = Standard Deviation</p>

<p>and ${n}$ = No.of observations </p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Calculate Standard Error for the following individual data:</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Let's first compute the Arithmetic Mean $\bar{x}$</p>

<p>Let's now compute the Standard Deviation ${s}$</p>

<p>Thus the Standard Error $SE_\bar{x}$</p>

<p>The Standard Error of the given numbers is 15.63.</p>

<p>The smaller the proportion of the population that is sampled the less is the effect of this multiplier because then the finite multiplier will be close to one and will affect the standard error negligibly. Hence if the sample size is less than 5% of population, the finite multiplier is ignored.</p>

<h1>Statistics - Standard normal table</h1>

<h2>Standard Normal Table</h2>

<p>Z is the standard normal random variable. The table value for Z is the value of the cumulative normal distribution at z. This is the left-tailed normal table. As z-value increases, the normal table value also increases. For example, the value for Z=1.96 is P (Z &lt; 1.96) = .9750.</p>

<title>Statistics - Statistical Significance</title>

<h1>Statistics - Statistical Significance</h1>

<p>Statistical Significance signifies that result of a statistical experiment or testing is not occuring randomly and is attributable to certain cause. Statistical significance of a result could be strong or weak and it is very important for sectors which are heavily dependent on research works like insurance, pharma, finance, physics and so.</p>

<p>Statistical Significance helps in choosing the sample data so that one can judge the result or outcome of testing to be realistic and not be caused by a random cause.</p>

<p>Statisticians generally formulates the degree of statistical significance by sampling error. Generally sampling error of 5% is acceptable. Sample size is also important as it should be representative sample instead of very large sample considering the fact that large samples are prone to errors.</p>

<h2>Significance Level</h2>

<p>A level at which an event is considered to be statistical significant is termed as significance level.  Statisticians uses a test statistic called p-value to get the statistical significance. If p-value of an event falls below a particular level then the event is considered as statistical significant. p-value is function of standard deviations and means of data samples. p-value is the probability of an event which certifies that result of statistical testing is occuring by chance or due to some sampling error. In other words it is the risk of failure of a statistical test. Opposite of p-value is confidence level which is 1 - p-value.</p>

<p>If p-value of a result is 5% then that means  confidence level of the result is 95%.</p>

<title>Statistics - Stem and Leaf Plot</title>

<h1>Statistics - Stem and Leaf Plot</h1>

<p>Stemplots are similar to histogram with the difference that in histogram, bars are used to compare data and in case of stemplots leaves represents actual numbers to be compared. Stemplots are also called stem and leaves plot as there is one step with largest place value digits on the left and at leaf(ves) to the right. A Stemplot is used to draw quantitative data with fewer than 50 observations.</p>

<p>In a stemplot, left side entries are called stems; and the right side entries are called leaves. In figure above, the stems are tens (here 5 represents 50, 6 represents 60, and so on); and the leaves are actual values. Stems and leaves may be labelled as - millions, thousands, ones, tenths, etc.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Draw Stemplot diagram for the following data points.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> - Sort the numbers in ascending order.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> - Choose step as largest place value. In our case it is 10. So each step will represent 10 units.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> - Group the numbers based on stem value.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> - Draw the stem numbers as 10's place-value digits 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (each number is representing 10 units).  Draw the leaves as 1's place value.</p>

<title>Statistics - Stratified sampling</title>

<h1>Statistics - Stratified sampling</h1>

<p>This strategy for examining is utilized as a part of circumstance where the population can be effortlessly partitioned into gatherings or strata which are particularly not quite the same as one another, yet the components inside of a gathering are homogeneous regarding a few attributes e. g. understudies of school can be separated into strata on the premise of sexual orientation, courses offered, age and so forth. In this the population is initially partitioned into strata and afterward a basic irregular specimen is taken from every stratum. Stratified testing is of two sorts: proportionate stratified inspecting and disproportionate stratified examining.</p>

<p><b>Proportionate Stratified Sampling</b> - In this the number of units selected from each stratum is proportionate to the share of stratum in the population e.g. in a college there are total 2500 students out of which 1500 students are enrolled in graduate courses and 1000 are enrolled in post graduate courses. If a sample of 100 is to be chosen using proportionate stratified sampling then the number of undergraduate students in sample would be 60 and 40 would be post graduate students. Thus the two strata are represented in the same proportion in the sample as is their representation in the population.</p>

<p>This method is most suitable when the purpose of sampling is to estimate the population value of some characteristic and there is no difference in within- stratum variances.</p>

<p><b>Disproportionate Stratified Sampling</b> - When the purpose of study is to compare the differences among strata then it become necessary to draw equal units from all strata irrespective of their share in population. Sometimes some strata are more variable with respect to some characteristic than other strata, in such a case a larger number of units may be drawn from the more variable strata. In both the situations the sample drawn is a disproportionate stratified sample.</p>

<p>The difference in stratum size and stratum variability can be optimally allocated using the following formula for determining the sample size from different strata</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${n_i = \frac{n.n_i\sigma_i}{n_1\sigma_1+n_2\sigma_2+...+n_k\sigma_k}\ for\ i = 1,2 ...k}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${n_i}$ = the sample size of i strata.</p>

<p>${n}$ = the size of strata.</p>

<p>${\sigma_1}$ = the standard deviation of i strata.</p>

<p>In addition to it, there might be a situation where cost of collecting a sample might be more in one strata than in other. The optimal disproportionate sampling should be done in a manner that</p>

<p>${\frac{n_1}{n_1\sigma_1\sqrt{c_1}} = \frac{n_2}{n_2\sigma_1\sqrt{c_2}} = ... = \frac{n_k}{n_k\sigma_k\sqrt{c_k}}}$</p>

<p>Where ${c_1, c_2, ... ,c_k}$ refer to the cost of sampling in k strata. The sample size from different strata can be determined using the following formula:</p>

<p>${n_i = \frac{\frac{n.n_i\sigma_i}{\sqrt{c_i}}}{\frac{n_1\sigma_1}{\sqrt{c_i}}+\frac{n_2\sigma_2}{\sqrt{c_2}}+...+\frac{n_k\sigma_k}{\sqrt{c_k}}}\ for\ i = 1,2 ...k}$</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>An organisation has 5000 employees who have been stratified into three levels.</p>

<p>Stratum A: 50 executives with standard deviation = 9</p>

<p>Stratum B: 1250 non-manual workers with standard deviation = 4</p>

<p>Stratum C: 3700 manual workers with standard deviation = 1</p>

<p>How will a sample of 300 employees are drawn on a disproportionate basis having optimum allocation?</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Using the formula of disproportionate sampling for optimum allocation.</p>

<title>Statistics - Student T Test</title>

<h1>Statistics - Student T Test</h1>

<p>T-test is small sample test. It was developed by William Gosset in 1908. He published this test under the pen name of "Student". Therefore, it is known as Student's t-test. For applying t-test, the value of t-statistic is computed. For this, the following formula is used:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${t} = \frac{Deviation\ from\ the\ population\ parameter}{Standard\ Error\ of\ the\ sample\ statistic}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${t}$ = Test of Hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Test of Hypothesis about population</h2>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>An irregular sample of 9 qualities from an ordinary populace demonstrated a mean of 41.5 inches and the entirety of square of deviation from this mean equivalent to 72 inches. Show whether the supposition of mean of 44.5 inches in the populace is reasonable.(For ${v}={8},\ {t_.05}={2.776}$)</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>${\bar x = 45.5}, {\mu = 44.5}, {n=9}, {\sum{(X-\bar X)}^2 = 72} $</p>

<p>Let us take the null hypothesis that the population mean is 44.5.</p>

<p>Applying t-test:</p>

<p>Degrees of freedom = $ {v = n-1 = 9-1 = 8 }$. For ${v = 8, t_{0.05}}$ for two tailed test = ${2.306}$.	Since, the calculated value of $ {|t|}$ &gt;  the table value of $ {t}$, we reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that the population mean is not equal to 44.5.</p>

<title>Statistics - Sum of Square</title>

<h1>Statistics - Sum of Square</h1>

<p>In statistical data analysis the total sum of squares (TSS or SST) is a quantity that appears as part of a standard way of presenting results of such analyses. It is defined as being the sum, over all observations, of the squared differences of each observation from the overall mean.</p>

<p>Total Sum of Squares is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${Sum\ of\ Squares\ = \sum(x_i - \bar x)^2 }$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${x_i}$ = frequency.</p>

<p>${\bar x}$ = mean.</p>

<title>Statistics - Transformations</title>

<h1>Statistics - Transformations</h1>

<p>Data transformation refers to application of a function to each item in a data set. Here $ x_i $ is replaced by its transformed value $ y_i $ where $ y_i  = f(x_i) $. Data transformations are carried out generally to make appearance of graphs more interpretable.</p>

<p>There are four major functions used for transformations.</p>

<p><b>$ log x $</b> - logarithm transformations. For example sound units are in decibels and is generally represented using log transformations.</p>

<p><b>$ \frac{1}{x} $</b> - Reciprocal Transformations. For example Time to complete race/ task is represents using speed. More the speed lesser the time taken.</p>

<p><b>$ \sqrt{x} $</b> - Square root Transformations. For example areas of circular ground are compared using their radius.</p>

<p><b>$ {x^2} $</b> - Power Transformations. For example to compare negative numbers.</p>

<p>logarithm and Square root Transformations are used in case of positive numbers where as Reciprocal and Power Transformations can be used in case of both negative as well as positive numbers.</p>

<p>Following diagrams illustrates the use of logarithm transformation to compare population graphically.</p>

<p>The Trimmed Mean can be calculated using the following formula.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>$\sum {X_i}$</span> = Sum of your Trimmed Set.</p>

<p>${n}$ = Total Numbers in Trimmed set.</p>

<title>Statistics - Type I &amp; II Errors</title>

<h1>Statistics - Type I &amp; II Errors</h1>

<p>Type I and Type II errors signifies the erroneous outcomes of statistical hypothesis tests. Type I error represents the incorrect rejection of a valid null hypothesis whereas Type II error represents the incorrect retention of an invalid null hypothesis.</p>

<h2>Null Hypothesis</h2>

<p>Null Hypothesis refers to a statement which nullifies the contrary with evidence. Consider the following examples:</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Here Null hypothesis is to be tested against experimental data to nullify the effect of floride and water on teeth's cavities.</p>

<h2>Type I Error</h2>

<p>Consider the Example 1. Here Null hypothesis is true i.e. Water added to a toothpaste has no effect against cavities. But if using experimental data, we detect an effect of water added on cavities then we are rejecting a true null hypothesis. This is a Type I error. It is also called a False Positive condition (a situation which indicates that a given condition is present but it actually is not present). The Type I error rate or significance level of Type I is represented by the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that it is true.</p>

<p>Type I error is denoted by $ \alpha $ and is also called alpha level. Generally It is acceptable to have Type I error significance level as 0.05 or 5% which means that 5% probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is acceptable.</p>

<h2>Type II Error</h2>

<p>Consider the Example 2. Here Null hypothesis is false i.e. Floride added to a toothpaste has effect against cavities. But if using experimental data, we do not detect an effect of floride added on cavities then we are accepting a false null hypothesis. This is a Type II error. It is also called a False Positive condition (a situation which indicates that a given condition is not present but it actually is present).</p>

<p>Type II error is denoted by $ \beta $ and is also called beta level.</p>

<p>Goal of a statistical test is to determine that a null hypothesis can be rejected or not. A statistical test can reject or not be able to reject a null hypothesis. Following table illustrates the relationship between truth or falseness of the null hypothesis and outcomes of the test in terms of Type I or Type II error.</p>

<title>Statistics - Variance</title>

<h1>Statistics - Variance</h1>

<p>A variance is defined as the average of Squared differences from mean value.</p>

<p>Combination is defined and given by the following function:</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>${ \delta = \frac{ \sum (M - n_i)^2 }{n}}$</p>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${M}$ = Mean of items.</p>

<p>${n}$ = the number of items considered.</p>

<p>${n_i}$ = items.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Find the variance between following data : {600, 470, 170, 430, 300}</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Determine the Mean of the given items.</p>

<p>Step 2: Determine Variance</p>

<title>Statistics - Venn Diagram</title>

<h1>Statistics - Venn Diagram</h1>

<p>Venn diagram is a way to visually represents relationship between groups of entities or objects. Venn diagrams are comprised of circles where each circle represents a whole set. Venn diagram can have unlimited circles but generally two or three circles are preferred otherwise the diagram becomes too complex.</p>

<h2>Steps to draw a Venn Diagram</h2>

<p>Consider the following sets of people:</p>

<p><b>Cricket Players</b> - $ C = \{ Ram, Shyam, Mohan, Rohan, Ramesh, Suresh \} $</p>

<p><b>Hockey Players</b> - $ H = \{ Ramesh, Naresh, Mahesh, Leela, Sunita \} $</p>

<p>Step 1: Draw a rectangle and label it as players.</p>

<p>Step 2: Draw two circles and label them as Cricket and Hockey. Make sure that circles are overlapping each other.</p>

<p>Step 3: Write Names inside the circle as relevant. Common name(s) should fall within common region.</p>

<h2>Union</h2>

<p>Union ($ \cup $) represents a set where items are present in all categories but are not repeated.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Draw a Venn diagram of $ C \cup H $.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Determine players who are either playing cricket or hockey. Draw them as following:</p>

<p>$ C \cup H  = \{ Ram, Shyam, Mohan, Rohan, Ramesh, Suresh, Naresh, Mahesh, Leela, Sunita \} $.</p>

<h2>Intersection</h2>

<p>Intersection ($ \cap $) represents a set where items are present in both categories.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Draw a Venn diagram of $ C \cap H $.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Determine players who are playing cricket and hockey both. Draw them as following:</p>

<p>$ C \cap H  = \{ Ramesh \} $.</p>

<h2>Difference</h2>

<p>Difference ($ - $) represents a set where items are present only in one category and not in other one.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>Draw a Venn diagram of $ C - H $.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>

<p>Step 1: Determine players who are playing cricket only. Draw them as following:</p>

<p>$ C - H  = \{ Ram, Shyam, Mohan, Rohan, Suresh \} $.</p>

<title>Statistics - Weak Law of Large Numbers</title>

<h1>Statistics - Weak Law of Large Numbers</h1>

<p>The weak law of large numbers is a result in probability theory also known as Bernoulli's theorem. Let P be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, each having a mean and standard deviation.</p>

<h2>Formula</h2>

<p>Where &minus; </p>

<p>${n}$ = Number of samples</p>

<p>${X}$ = Sample value</p>

<p>${\mu}$ = Sample mean</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p><b>Problem Statement:</b></p>

<p>A six sided die is rolled large number of times. Figure the sample mean of their values.</p>

<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
