<title>Rexx Overview</title>

<h1>Rexx - Overview</h1>

<p><b>Rexx (Restructured Extended Executor)</b> is designed to be a scripting language. Its goal is to make scripting as easy, fast, reliable, and error-free as possible. Many programming languages are designed for compatibility with older languages, and are written for specific audiences or platforms. Rexx ignores extraneous objectives. It was designed from day one to be powerful, yet easy to use.</p>

<p>Rexx was designed and first implemented, in assembly language, as an 'own-time' project between 20<sup>th</sup> March 1979 and the middle of 1982 by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM, originally as a scripting programming language to replace the languages <b>EXEC and EXEC 2</b>. It was designed to be a <b>macro or scripting language</b> for any system. As such, Rexx is considered a precursor to Tcl and Python. Rexx was also intended by its creator to be a simplified and easier to learn version of the PL/I programming language.</p>

<title>Rexx Basic Syntax</title>

<h1>Rexx - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>In order to understand the basic syntax of Rexx, let us first look at a simple Hello World program.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>One can see how simple the hello world program is. It is a simple script line which is used to execute the Hello World program.</p>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>say command</b> is used to output a value to the console.</p>

<p>The <b>/* */</b> is used for comments in Rexx.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>General Form of a Statement</h2>

<p>In Rexx, let’s see a general form of a program. Take a look at the following example.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<p>Let’s go through what we have understood from the above program &minus;</p>

<p>Add is a function defined to add 2 numbers.</p>

<p>In the main program, the values of 5 and 6 is used as parameters to the add function.</p>

<p>The exit keyword is used to exit from the main program. This is used to differentiate the main program from the add function.</p>

<p>The add function is differentiated with the ‘:’ symbol.</p>

<p>The parse statement is used to parse the incoming arguments.</p>

<p>Finally, the return statement is used to return the sum of the numeric values.</p>

<h3>Subroutines and Functions</h3>

<p>In Rexx, the code is normally divided into subroutines and functions. Subroutines and functions are used to differentiate the code into different logical units. The key difference between subroutines and functions is that functions return a value whereas subroutines don’t.</p>

<p>Below is a key difference example between a subroutine and a function for an addition implementation &minus;</p>

<h3>Function Implementation</h3>

<h3>Subroutine Implementation</h3>

<p>The output of both the programs will be the value 11.</p>

<h2>Executing Commands</h2>

<p>Rexx can be used as a control language for a variety of command-based systems. The way that Rexx executes commands in these systems is as follows. When Rexx encounters a program line which is neither an instruction nor an assignment, it treats that line as a string expression which is to be evaluated and then passed to the environment.</p>

<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Each of the three similar lines in this program is a string expression which adds the name of a file (contained in the string constants) to the name of a command (given as a parameter). The resulting string is passed to the environment to be executed as a command. When the command has finished, the variable "rc" is set to the exit code of the command.</p>

<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Keywords in Rexx</h2>

<p>The free syntax of REXX implies that some symbols are reserved for the language processor's use in certain contexts.</p>

<p>Within particular instructions, some symbols may be reserved to separate the parts of the instruction. These symbols are referred to as keywords. Examples of REXX keywords are the <b>WHILE in a DO instruction</b>, and the <b>THEN</b> (which acts as a clause terminator in this case) following an <b>IF or WHEN clause</b>.</p>

<p>Apart from these cases, only simple symbols that are the first token in a clause and that are not followed by an "=" or ":" are checked to see if they are instruction keywords. You can use the symbols freely elsewhere in clauses without their being taken to be keywords.</p>

<h2>Comments in Rexx</h2>

<p>Comments are used to document your code. Single line comments are identified by using the /* */ at any position in the line.</p>

<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Comments can also be written in between a code line as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<p>You can also have multiple lines in a comment as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<title>Rexx DataTypes</title>

<h1>Rexx - DataTypes</h1>

<p>In any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various types of information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory to store the value associated with that variable.</p>

<p>You may like to store information of various data types like String, Character, Wide Character, Integer, Floating Point, Boolean, etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>

<h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>

<p>Rexx offers a wide variety of built-in data types. Following is a list of data types which are defined in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>Integer</b> &minus; A string of numerics that does not contain a decimal point or exponent identifier. The first character can be <b>a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign</b>. The number that is represented must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647, inclusive.</p>

<p><b>Big Integer</b> &minus; A string of numbers that does not contain a decimal point or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented must be between -9223372036854775808 and 2147483648, inclusive, or between 2147483648 and 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; It will be from one of the following formats &minus;</p>

<p>A string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier. The <b>p</b> represents the precision and <b>s</b> represents the scale of the decimal number that the string represents. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p>A string of numerics that <b>does not contain a decimal point</b> or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented is less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Float</b> &minus; A string that represents a number in scientific notation. The string consists of a series of numerics followed by an exponent identifier (an E or e followed by an optional plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign and a series of numerics). The string can begin with a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p><b>String</b> &minus; A normal string of characters.</p>

<p>Following are some examples of how each data type can be used. Again each data type will be discussed in detail in the subsequent chapters. This is just to get you up to speed with a brief description of the above mentioned data types.</p>

<title>Rexx Variables</title>

<h1>Rexx - Variables</h1>

<p>In Rexx, all variables are bound with the ‘=’ statement. Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘<b>. ! ? _</b>’. A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or a period. A simple variable name does not include a period. A variable name that includes a period is called a compound variable and represents an array or table.</p>

<p>The following are the basic types of variables in Rexx which were also explained in the previous chapter &minus;</p>

<p><b>Integers</b> &minus; This is used to represent an integer or a float. An example for this is 10.</p>

<p><b>Big integers</b> &minus; This represents a large integer value.</p>

<p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; A decimal value is a string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier.</p>

<p><b>Float</b> &minus; A float value is a string that represents a number in the scientific notation.</p>

<p><b>String</b> &minus; A series of characters defines a string in Rexx.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Variable Functions</h2>

<p>In this section, we will discuss regarding the various functions a variable can perform.</p>

<h3>Variable Declarations</h3>

<p>The general syntax of defining a variable is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>var-name</b> &minus; This is the name of the variable.</p>

<p><b>var-value</b> &minus; This is the value bound to the variable.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the variable declaration &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>In the above example, we have 2 variables, one is <b>X</b> which is bound to the value <b>40</b> and the next is <b>Y</b> which is bound to the value of <b>50</b>. Another variable called Result is bound to the addition of <b>X and Y</b>.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Naming Variables</h3>

<p>Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘. ! ? _’ . A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or period.</p>

<p>If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, it is referred to as uninitialized. The value of an uninitialized variable is the name of the variable itself in uppercase letters.</p>

<p>An example of an unassigned variable is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<title>Rexx Operators</title>

<h1>Rexx - Operators</h1>

<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.</p>

<p>Rexx has various types of operators which are also explained in detail as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>The Rexx language supports the normal Arithmetic Operators as any the language. Following are the Arithmetic Operators available in Rexx.</p>

<p><a href="/rexx/rexx_arithmetic_operators.htm" >Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>

<title>Rexx Arrays</title>

<h1>Rexx - Arrays</h1>

<p>Arrays in any programming language allow you to group a list of values of the same type. The use of arrays is that it allows you to build a list of similar type of values which are <b>sortable, searchable</b> and can be <b>easily manipulated</b>. Rexx also allows one to define arrays. These arrays can be one dimensional or multidimensional.</p>

<p>Rexx arrays may be sparse. That is, not every array position must have a value or even be initialized. There can be empty array positions, or slots, between those that do contain data elements. Or arrays can be dense, in which consecutive array slots all contain data elements.</p>

<p>In many programming languages, you must be concerned with what the subscript of the first entry in a table is. Is the first numeric subscript 0 or 1? In Rexx, the first subscript is whatever you use! So, input the first array element into position 0 or 1 as you prefer.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Let’s look at the different operations available for arrays.</p>

<h2>Creating Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays are created with the same naming convention which is used for variables in Rexx.</p>

<p>The general syntax for creating arrays is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>Arrayname</b> &minus; This is the name provided to the array.</p>

<p><b>Index</b> &minus; This is the index position in the array to refer to a specific element.</p>

<p><b>Value</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the index element in the array.</p>

<p>An example of an array declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The following points needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<h2>Assigning Values to an Array Element</h2>

<p>Values can be re-assigned to array elements in the same way as array elements are initialized.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of values which can be assigned to various index values of an existing array.</p>

<h3>Displaying Values of an Array</h3>

<p>The values of an array can be displayed by referring to the index position of the array element. The following example shows to access various elements of the array.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Copying Arrays</h2>

<p>All of the elements of an array can be copied onto another array. The general syntax of this is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>Newarray</b> &minus; This is the new array in which the elements need to be copied onto.</p>

<p><b>Sourcearray</b> &minus; This is the source array from which the elements need to be copied.</p>

<p>An example on how the copy operations for arrays can be carried out is shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Iterating through array elements</h2>

<p>Elements of an array can also be iterated by using the iterative statements available in Rexx. An example on how this can be done is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The following pointers need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to iterate through the array elements.</p>

<p>The variable <b>number_of_elements</b> is used to store the number of elements in the array.</p>

<p>The <b>variable j</b> is used to iterate through each element of the array.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Two-dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>It was also mentioned that we can construct multi-dimensional arrays in Rexx. Let’s look at an example of how we can implement a 2-dimensional array.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The following point needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>To create a multidimensional array, we can use another layer of indexing. So in our example, we used <b>list.1.1</b> to create another inner array for the index value 1 of the list array.</p>

<title>Rexx Loops</title>

<h1>Rexx - Loops</h1>

<p>So far we have seen statements which have been executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Additionally, statements are provided in Rexx to alter the flow of control in a program’s logic. They are then classified into a flow of control statements which we will study in detail.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following illustration is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages.</p>

<p>Let us discuss various loops supported by Rexx.</p>

<p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to execute a number of statements for a certain number of times. The number of times that the statement needs to be executed is determined by the value passed to the do loop.</p>

<p>The do-while statement is used to simulate the simple while loop which is present in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The do-until loop is a slight variation of the do while loop. This loop varies in the fact that is exits when the condition being evaluated is false.</p>

<h2>Controlled Repetition</h2>

<p>The do loops can be catered to carry out a controlled repetition of statements.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The general syntax of this sort of statement is as follows.</p>

<p>The difference in this statement is that there is an index which is used to control the number of times the loop is executed. Secondly, there are parameters which state the value which the index should start with, where it should end and what is the increment value.</p>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>Let’s check out the flow diagram of this loop &minus;</p>

<p>From the above diagram you can clearly see that the loop is executed based on the index value and how the index value is incremented.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the controlled repetition statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above program, the value of the <b>count i</b> is set to 0 first. Then it is incremented in counts of 2 till the value is not greater than 5.</p>

<p>The output of the above code will be &minus;</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
do index = start [to limit] [by increment] [for count] 
statement #1 
statement #2 
end

<title>Rexx Decision Making</title>

<h1>Rexx - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the general form of a typical decision-making structure found in most of the programming languages.</p>

<p>There is a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the various decision-making statements available in Rexx.</p>

<p>The first decision-making statement is the <b>if</b> statement. An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>The next decision-making statement is the if-else statement. An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p>

<h2>Nested If Statements</h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a requirement to have <b>multiple if statements</b> embedded inside each other, as is possible in other programming languages. In Rexx also this is possible.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>The flow diagram of nested <b>if</b> statements is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Let’s take an example of nested <b>if</b> statement &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Select Statements</h2>

<p>Rexx offers the select statement which can be used to execute expressions based on the output of the select statement.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The general form of this statement is &minus;</p>

<p>The general working of this statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The select statement has a range of when statements to evaluate different conditions.</p>

<p>Each <b>when clause</b> has a different condition which needs to be evaluated and the subsequent statement is executed.</p>

<p>The otherwise statement is used to run any default statement if the previous when conditions do not <b>evaluate to true</b>.</p>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>The flow diagram of the <b>select</b> statement is as follows</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the case statement in Rexx.</p>

<title>Rexx Functions</title>

<h1>Rexx - Functions</h1>

<p>The code in Rexx is normally divided into Functions and Subroutines. Using functions helps in segregating the code into many more logical units. Let’s look at these functions in detail.</p>

<h2>Defining a Function</h2>

<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the function.</p>

<p><b>PARSE ARG</b> &minus; These are keywords in Rexx which are used to mention that parameters are being passed onto the function.</p>

<p><b>arguement1, arguement2… arguementN</b> &minus; These are the arguments passed to the function.</p>

<p><b>Return value</b> &minus; This is the value returned by the function.</p>

<p>The following program is a simple example of how functions are used in Rexx.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a function called add which accepts 2 parameters a and b.</p>

<p>The function uses the return statement to return the sum of a and b.</p>

<p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>

<p>In Rexx, there are specific functions which can be made to work with arguments. Let’s look at a couple of such arguments.</p>

<h3>arg</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the function.</p>

<h2>Recursive Functions</h2>

<p>A recursive function or routine is one that calls itself. Any recursive function could be coded in a traditional non-recursive fashion (or iteratively), but sometimes recursion offers a better problem solution. Not all programming languages support recursion; Rexx does.</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of the famous factorial program using recursive functions in Rexx.</p>

<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>

<title>Rexx Stacks</title>

<h1>Rexx - Stacks</h1>

<p>The stack is sometimes called the external data queue, but we follow common usage and refer to it as the stack. It is a block of memory that is logically external to Rexx. Instructions like push and queue place data into the stack, and instructions like pull and parse pull extract data from it. The queued built-in function reports how many items are in the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of a stack.</p>

<p>The first do loop in the program places three lines of data onto the stack. It uses the push instruction to do this. We number the lines so that when they are retrieved in the LIFO order their order is apparent.</p>

<p>The items placed into the stack by the push instruction are retrieved in the LIFO order &minus;</p>

<p>The next code block shows the use of the queued built-in function to discover the number of lines on the stack, as well as a loop to retrieve all the lines from the stack &minus;</p>

<p>Since the three items were placed on the stack via push, they are retrieved in the LIFO order.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>

<title>Rexx File I/O</title>

<h1>Rexx - File I/O</h1>

<p>Rexx provides a number of methods when working with I/O. Rexx provides easier classes to provide the following functionalities for files.</p>

<p>The functions available in Rexx for File I/O are based on both line input and character input and we will be looking at the functions available for both in detail.</p>

<p>Let’s explore some of the file operations Rexx has to offer. For the purposes of these examples, we are going to assume that there is a file called <b>NewFile.txt</b> which contains the following lines of text &minus;</p>

<p>This file will be used for the read and write operations in the following examples. Here we will discuss regarding how to read the contents on a file in different ways.</p>

<h2>Reading the Contents of a File a Line at a Time</h2>

<p>The general operations on files are carried out by using the methods available in the Rexx library itself. The reading of files is the simplest of all operations in Rexx.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the function used to accomplish this.</p>

<h3>linein</h3>

<p>This method returns a line from the text file. The text file is the filename provided as the input parameter to the function.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be read.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns one line of the file at a time.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p>The above code is pretty simple in the fact that the <b>Example.txt</b> file name is provided to the linein function. This function then reads a line of text and provides the result to the variable <b>line_str</b>.</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Reading the Contents of a File at One Time</h2>

<p>In Rexx, reading all the contents of a file can be achieved with the help of the while statement. The while statement will read each line, one by one till the end of the file is reached.</p>

<p>An example on how this can be achieved is shown below.</p>

<p>In the above program, the following things need to be noted &minus;</p>

<p>The lines function reads the <b>Example.txt</b> file.</p>

<p>The while function is used to check if further lines exist in the Example.txt file.</p>

<p>For each line read from the file, the <b>line_str</b> variable holds the value of the current line. This is then sent to the console as output.</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Writing Contents to a File</h2>

<p>Just like reading of files, Rexx also has the ability to write to files. Let’s look at the function which is used to accomplish this.</p>

<h3>lineout</h3>

<p>This method writes a line to a file. The file to which the line needs to be written to is provided as the parameter to the lineout statement.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be written to.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the status of the lineout function. The value returned is 0 if the line was successfully written else the value of 1 will be returned.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; Whenever the above code is run, the line “Example4” will be written to the file <b>Example.txt</b>.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
line_str = linein(Example.txt) 
say line_str
</pre>
<p>The above code is pretty simple in the fact that the <b>Example.txt</b> file name is provided to the linein function. This function then reads a line of text and provides the result to the variable <b>line_str</b>.</p>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<title>Rexx Functions For Files</title>

<h1>Rexx - Functions For Files</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we will discuss regarding some of the other functions that are available for files.</p>

<p>This function returns either the value 1 or the number of lines left to read in an input stream. The filename is given as the input to the function.</p>

<p>This function is used to check the status of a file. Sometimes it is required to check the status of a file before it is used. If the file is corrupt or not available, then no further operations can be performed on the file. So it makes more sense to first check the status of the file.</p>

<p>This function is used to read one character at a time from a file. Sometimes programs require to read files character wise and hence this function can be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>This function returns either 1 or the number of characters left to read in the file itself. The filename is mentioned as a parameter to the function.</p>

<p>This function is used to write one character at a time to a file. The filename is entered as a parameter to the function.</p>

<title>Rexx Subroutines</title>

<h1>Rexx - Subroutines</h1>

<p>In any programming language, the entire program is broken into logical modules. This makes it easier to write code that can be maintained easily. This is a basic requirement for any programming language.</p>

<p>In Rexx, modules can be written using Subroutines and functions. Let’s look at the subroutines in detail.</p>

<h2>Defining a Subroutine</h2>

<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Statement#1 .. Statement#N</b> &minus; These are the list of statements that make up the subroutine.</p>

<p>The following program is a simple example showing the use of subroutines.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a subroutine called <b>add</b>.</p>

<p>The subroutine does a simple add functionality.</p>

<p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>

<p>It is also possible to work with arguments in Rexx. The following example shows how this can be achieved.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a subroutine called add which takes on 2 parameters.</p>

<p>In the subroutines, the 2 parameters are parsed using the PARSE and ARG keyword.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Different Methods for Arguments</h2>

<p>Let’s look at some other methods available for arguments.</p>

<h3>arg</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; None</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>

<title>Rexx Built-In Functions</title>

<h1>Rexx - Built-In Functions</h1>

<p>Every programming language has some built-in functions that help the programmer do some routine tasks. Rexx also has a lot of built in functions.</p>

<p>Let’s look at all of these functions available in Rexx.</p>

<p>This method returns the name of the environment in the which the Rexx commands are currently running in.</p>

<p>This method produces a sound in the system at a particular frequency and duration.</p>

<p>This method returns the value of ‘NUM’ if the input is a valid number else it will return the value of ‘CHAR’. You can also specify if you want to compare the input value to a NUM or CHAR value. In each case, the value returned will be either 1 or 0 depending on the result.</p>

<p>This method returns the local date in the following format.</p>

<p>This method returns the current setting of NUMERIC DIGITS as defined in the current system.</p>

<p>This method returns the Rexx error message associated with error number ‘errorno’. Please note that the error number needs to be a value from 0 to 99. This is useful in cases wherein your program returned an error code and you want to know what the error code means.</p>

<p>This method returns the current setting of ‘NUMERIC FORM’ which is used to do mathematic calculations on the system.</p>

<p>This method returns the local time in the 24-hour clock format as shown in the following program.</p>

<p>This method returns the current user id logged into the system.</p>

<p>This method returns the characters in the range specified by the start and end character.</p>

<p>This method returns the decimal conversion of a <b>hexstring value</b>.</p>

<p>This method returns the character conversion of a hexstring value.</p>

<title>Rexx System Commands</title>

<h1>Rexx - System Commands</h1>

<p>One of the biggest advantages in Rexx is the ability to create re-usable scripts. Often in organizations nowadays, having re-usable scripts is a big value add in saving time to do common repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>For example, technology teams in an IT organization can have the need to have scripts which do common everyday tasks. These tasks can include interacting with the operating systems. These scripts can then be programmed to handle bad return codes or errors.</p>

<p>Rexx offers a lot of system commands that can be used to perform such repetitive tasks. Let’s look at some of the system commands available in Rexx.</p>

<h2>dir</h2>

<p>This is the normal directory listing command which is used in Windows.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the current directory listing on the system.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output depends on the directory in the system.</p>

<p>The following program is just an example.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Another example of the <b>dir command</b> is shown in the following program. Only this time we are making use of the <b>special rc variable</b>. This variable is special in Rexx and gives you the status of the execution of system commands. If the value returned is 0, then that means the command is executed successfully. Else the error number will be given in the rc variable name.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h2>Redirection Commands</h2>

<p>Rexx also has the facility of using redirection commands. The following redirection commands are available in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>&lt;</b> &minus; This command is used to take in the input which comes from a file.</p>

<p><b>&gt;</b> &minus; This command is used to output the content to a file. If the file does exist, it will be over-written.</p>

<p><b>&gt;&gt;</b> &minus; This is also used to output the content to a file. But the output is added to the end of the file to preserve the existing content of the file.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example of how we can use redirection commands. In the following example, we are using the sort command to sort a file called <b>sortin.txt</b>. The data from the file is sent to the sort command. The output of the sort command is then sent to the sortout.txt file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Assume that the file sortin.txt has the following data.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The file <b>sortout.txt</b> will then have the following data.</p>

<h2>The ADDRESS Function</h2>

<p>This method is used to find out what is the default environment used for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>Options for what is the address of a particular system.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the name of the environment for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
dir
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>This method returns the current directory listing on the system.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */

<p>Another example of the <b>dir command</b> is shown in the following program. Only this time we are making use of the <b>special rc variable</b>. This variable is special in Rexx and gives you the status of the execution of system commands. If the value returned is 0, then that means the command is executed successfully. Else the error number will be given in the rc variable name.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
dir 
if rc = 0 then 
   say 'The command executed successfully' 
else 
   say 'The command failed, The error code is =' rc 
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The command failed, The error code is = 127 
</pre>
<h2>Redirection Commands</h2>
<p>Rexx also has the facility of using redirection commands. The following redirection commands are available in Rexx.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>&lt;</b> &minus; This command is used to take in the input which comes from a file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>&gt;</b> &minus; This command is used to output the content to a file. If the file does exist, it will be over-written.</p></li>
<li><p><b>&gt;&gt;</b> &minus; This is also used to output the content to a file. But the output is added to the end of the file to preserve the existing content of the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example of how we can use redirection commands. In the following example, we are using the sort command to sort a file called <b>sortin.txt</b>. The data from the file is sent to the sort command. The output of the sort command is then sent to the sortout.txt file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="sortout.txt">
/* Main program */ 
'sort &lt;sortin.txt&gt; sortout.txt' 
</pre>
<p>Assume that the file sortin.txt has the following data.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
b 
c 
a
</pre>
<p>The file <b>sortout.txt</b> will then have the following data.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate" id="sortout.txt">
a 
b 
c 
</pre>
<h2>The ADDRESS Function</h2>
<p>This method is used to find out what is the default environment used for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ADDRESS(options) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Options for what is the address of a particular system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>This method returns the name of the environment for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say ADDRESS('I') 
say ADDRESS('O') 
say ADDRESS('E')
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<title>Rexx XML</title>

<h1>Rexx - XML</h1>

<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of the operating system and/or developmental language. This is one of the most common languages used for exchanging data between applications.</p>

<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p>The Extensible Markup Language XML is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard. XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring a SQL-based backbone.</p>

<p>For all our XML code examples, let's use the following simple XML file <b>movies.xml</b> for construction of the XML file and reading the file subsequently.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>By default, the xml functionality is not included in the Rexx interpreter. In order to work with XML in Rexx, the following steps need to be followed.</p>

<p>Download the following files &minus;</p>

<p>Rexxxml &minus; <a href="https://www.interlog.com/~ptjm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.interlog.com/~ptjm/</a></p>

<p>Libxml2 &minus; <a href="https://ctindustries.net/libxml/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ctindustries.net/libxml/</a></p>

<p>iconv-1.9.2.win32 &minus; <a href="https://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/</a></p>

<p>libxslt-1.1.26.win32 &minus; <a href="https://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/</a></p>

<p>Extract all of the files and ensure they are included in the system path.</p>

<h3>Loading XML Functions</h3>

<p>Once all the files in the above section have been downloaded and successfully registered, the next step is to write the code to load the Rexx XML functions. This is done with the following code.</p>

<p>The following things can be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The function <b>rxfuncadd</b> is used to load external libraries. The <b>xmlloadfuncs</b> function is used to load all the libraries in the <b>rexxxml</b> file into memory.</p>

<p>If the value of rcc&lt;&gt;0, then it would result in an error. For this , we can call the <b>rxfuncerrmsg</b> to give us more details on the error message.</p>

<p>We finally make a call to <b>xmlloadfuncs</b>, so that all xml related functionality can now be enabled in the Rexx program.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the various <b>methods available for XML in Rexx</b>.</p>

<h2>xmlVersion</h2>

<p>This method returns the version of the XML and XSLT libraries used on the system.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the version of the XML and XSLT libraries used on the system.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result. This again depends on the version of the XML libraries being used on the system.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h2>xmlParseXML</h2>

<p>This function is used to parse the XML data sent to the function. The document tree is returned by the function.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>Filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML file which needs to be parsed.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The document tree is returned by the function. Else returns 0, if there is an error.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>No general output.</p>

<h2>xmlFindNode</h2>

<p>This method evaluates the <b>XPath expression</b> passed to it. This is used for parsing the document tree to result a <b>nodeset</b> which can be processed further.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>XPath</b> &minus; This is the path of the node in the xml file.</p>

<p><b>document</b> &minus; This the XML document</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>Evaluates XPath expression and returns result as a nodeset which can be used later on.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output shows the number of movie nodes in our xml list</p>

<h2>xmlEvalExpression</h2>

<p>The below method is used to Evaluate an XPath expression and return a string as a result.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>XPath</b> &minus; This is the path of the node in the xml file.</p>

<p><b>document</b> &minus; The specific node element.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A string is returned based on the XPath expression sent to it.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result.</p>

<title>Rexx Regina</title>

<h1>Rexx - Regina</h1>

<p>Regina is another Rexx interpreter available to compile and run Rexx programs. The official site for Regina is &minus; <a href="https://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>Some of the advantages of using Regina are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Regina can run on any platform whether it be Windows, Linux or the Mac OS.</p>

<p>Regina works as per all available standards.</p>

<p>Regina has a big community following and hence there are a lot of forums and learning material available for Regina.</p>

<p>Regina has a lot of tools available for writing and testing Rexx programs.</p>

<p>In Regina, you can run commands which are not possible in the default Rexx Interpreter. For example, if you include certain configuration settings, you can actually run basic system level commands, which is not possible in Rexx.</p>

<p>When you install Rexx via the installation documented in <b>Chapter 2 – Rexx Environment</b>, the Regina interpreter gets installed along with it.</p>

<p>Now let’s see some of the common methods available when using Regina. These functions are the extended functions which are not available via normal use.</p>

<p>To make use of the extended functions, you need to include the following line of code. This enables the use of Regina extended functions.</p>

<p>Secondly while running all Rexx programs, use the following command.</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>regina</b> &minus; This is the interpreter used for Rexx programs.</p>

<p><b>main.rexx</b> &minus; Your Rexx program</p>

<p>We will now discuss in detail the various <b>functions of Regina Rexx Interpreter</b>.</p>

<p>This method is used to convert a binary value to a string value.</p>

<p>The method is used to compare 2 bit strings, bit by bit.</p>

<p>This method is used to indicate the state of the specified bit in the bit string.</p>

<p>This method is used to search for the first occurrence of a string in another string.</p>

<p>This method returns the value of an environment variable on the system.</p>

<p>This method is used to get the value of the current running process id.</p>

<p>This method returns the hash attribute of a string as a decimal number. It also updates the internal hash value of the string.</p>

<p>This method is used to add justify or trim the value of a string based on the length value.</p>

<p>This method is used to set the value of an environment variable.</p>

<p>This method gets the value of the current directory on the system.</p>

<p>This method changes the value of the current working directory on the system.</p>

<p>This method returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.</p>

<title>Rexx Parsing</title>

<h1>Rexx - Parsing</h1>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Rexx is its ability to parse text values. You probably will not see this in any other programming languages.</p>

<p>The general format of the parse statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>UPPER</b> &minus; The source is converted to upper case before parsing.</p>

<p><b>LOWER</b> &minus; The source is converted to lower case before parsing.</p>

<p><b>CASELESS</b> &minus; When this parameter is passed, the casing is ignored.</p>

<p><b>source</b> &minus; This is the source which needs to be parsed. There are many options available for this and can be any one of the following &minus;</p>

<p><b>ARG</b> &minus; The arguments for the program or procedure can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>LINEIN</b> &minus; The next line input can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>SOURCE</b> &minus; The source information of the program can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>VAR name</b> &minus; The value of a variable name can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>template</b> &minus; This parameter specifies how to parse the source. There are many options available for this. Some of them are mentioned below.</p>

<p><b>variable name</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the variable.</p>

<p><b>literal string</b> &minus; A literal string which can be used a pattern to split the strung.</p>

<p><b>#</b> &minus; An absolute character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used.</p>

<p><b>&plus;#</b> &minus; A relative character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used relatively.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example of how parsing can be accomplished in Rexx.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above program parses the words in the phrase. When a value consists of words that are separated by only one space, and there are no leading or trailing spaces, the value is easy to parse into a known number of words as follows.</p>

<p>The parse function is used in Rexx to take a string value and then break them down into words. In the above example, the words are then split and then stored in the word variables.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Another example of parsing is shown in the following program. This time we are using a while clause to do the parsing.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above program will give the following output &minus;</p>

<h2>Positional Parsing</h2>

<p>Rexx also allows one to work with positional parsing. Let’s see an example of how we can achieve positional parsing with the parse statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>From the above example, you can note that along with the variable name, we are also specifying where the string should end. So for name1, we should end by the 11th character and then starting parsing name2.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>You can also use <b>relative positional parsing</b> in this case.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at a simple example of how parsing can be accomplished in Rexx.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */

<p>The above program parses the words in the phrase. When a value consists of words that are separated by only one space, and there are no leading or trailing spaces, the value is easy to parse into a known number of words as follows.</p>
<p>The parse function is used in Rexx to take a string value and then break them down into words. In the above example, the words are then split and then stored in the word variables.</p>
<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
'This' 
'is' 
'a' 
'Tutorial' 
</pre>
<p>Another example of parsing is shown in the following program. This time we are using a while clause to do the parsing.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
phrase = 'This is a Tutorial' 

do while phrase &lt;&gt; '' 
   parse var phrase word phrase 
   say "'"word"'" 
   end 
</pre>
<p>The above program will give the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
'This' 
'is' 
'a' 
'Tutorial'

<p>Rexx also allows one to work with positional parsing. Let’s see an example of how we can achieve positional parsing with the parse statement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
testString = "Doe       John M.   03/03/78  Mumbai              India"; 
parse var testString name1 11 name2 21 birthday 31 town 51 country 
say name1 
say name2 
say birthday 
say town 
say country
</pre>
<p>From the above example, you can note that along with the variable name, we are also specifying where the string should end. So for name1, we should end by the 11th character and then starting parsing name2.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Doe 
John M. 
03/03/78 
Mumbai 
India
</pre>
<p>You can also use <b>relative positional parsing</b> in this case.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
testString = "Doe       John M.   03/03/78  Mumbai              India"; 
parse var testString name1 +10 name2 +10 birthday +10 town +20 country 
say name1 
say name2 
say birthday 
say town 
say country
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Doe 
John M. 
03/03/78 
Mumbai 
India 
</pre>

<title>Rexx Signals</title>

<h1>Rexx - Signals</h1>

<p>In Rexx, the signal instruction is used generally for two purposes, which are &minus;</p>

<p>One is to transfer control to another part of the program. This is normally like the go-to label which is used in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The other is to go to a specific trap label.</p>

<p>If the signal command is used in any of the following instruction commands, the pending control structures will automatically be deactivated.</p>

<p>if ... then ... else ...</p>

<p>do ... end</p>

<p>do i = 1 to n ... end [and similar do loops]</p>

<p>select when ... then ... ...etc. otherwise ... end</p>

<p>The general syntax of the signal statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Let’s look at an example of how to use the signal statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>If you change the value of the variable n to a whole number as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>You will get the following output &minus;</p>

<p>One can also transfer to the value of the label as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Trap Label Transfer Activation / Deactivation</h2>

<p>As we have mentioned earlier, the signal instruction can also be used to transfer control to a trap label.</p>

<p>The general syntax of the Trap label transfer is given as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><b>conditionName</b> &minus; This is the condition for which the signal should be either be turned on or off.</p>

<p><b>Label</b> &minus; The optional label to which the program should be diverted to.</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of using a trap label transfer.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>

<title>Rexx Debugging</title>

<h1>Rexx - Debugging</h1>

<p>Debugging is an important feature in any programming language. It helps the developer to diagnose errors, find the root cause and then resolve them accordingly. In Rexx, the trace utility is used for debugging. The trace instruction can be implemented in 2 ways, one is the batch mode and the other is the interactive mode. Let’s look at how to implement both options.</p>

<h2>Trace in Batch Mode</h2>

<p>The trace command is used to give a detailed level of each Rexx command which is executed.</p>

<p>The general syntax of the trace statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where the setting can be anyone of the following options &minus;</p>

<p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands.</p>

<p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p>

<p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p>

<p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p>

<p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p>

<p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p>

<p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of the trace command.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>From the output, you can see that an additional trace was added to the output of the program. The following things can be noted about the output &minus;</p>

<p>The line number along with the statement executed is added to the trace output.</p>

<p>Each line that gets executed is shown in the trace output.</p>

<h2>Trace Function</h2>

<p>Trace can also be enabled with the help of the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The above function returns the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>

<p>The first line of N denotes that the trace is set to Normal.</p>

<h2>Setting Trace Value</h2>

<p>The trace level can be set with the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>trace_level</b> &minus; This is similar to the options available for setting the trace level.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Interactive Tracing</h2>

<p>Interactive tracing is wherein, tracing is carried out as the program runs. Just like in an IDE such as Visual Studio for .Net, in which you can add breakpoints and see how each statement executes, similarly here also you can see the program as each code line runs.</p>

<p>The general syntax is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where, options are the same for the trace command as shown below.</p>

<p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands</p>

<p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p>

<p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p>

<p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p>

<p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p>

<p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p>

<p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of implementing active tracing.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown in the following program. The trace will stop at each line of code; then you need to press the Enter button to move onto the next line of code.</p>

<title>Rexx Error Handling</title>

<h1>Rexx - Error Handling</h1>

<p>Rexx has the ability to also work on Error handling as in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The following are some of the various error conditions that are seen in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>ERROR</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in an error.</p>

<p><b>FAILURE</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in a failure.</p>

<p><b>HALT</b> &minus; This is normally raised whenever an operation is dependent on another operation. An example is if an I/O operation is being halted for any reason.</p>

<p><b>NOVALUE</b> &minus; This event is raised when a value has not been assigned to a variable.</p>

<p><b>NOTREADY</b> &minus; This is raised by any I/O device which is not ready to accept any operation.</p>

<p><b>SYNTAX</b> &minus; This event is raised if there is any syntax error in the code.</p>

<p><b>LOSTDIGITS</b> &minus; This event is raised when an arithmetic operation results in a loss of digits during the operation.</p>

<h2>Trapping Errors</h2>

<p>Errors are trapped with the help of the signal command. Let’s take a look at the syntax and an example of this.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><b>Errorcondition</b> &minus; This is the error condition which is given above.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example on this.</p>

<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<title>Rexx Object Oriented</title>

<h1>Rexx - Object Oriented</h1>

<p>When you install ooRexx as per the environment chapter, you will also have the ability to work with classes and objects. Please note that all of the following code needs to be run in the ooRexx interpreter. The normal Rexx interpreter will not be able to run this object oriented code.</p>

<h2>Class and Method Declarations</h2>

<p>A class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>where <b>classname</b> is the name given to the class.</p>

<p>A method in a class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the name given to the method.</p>

<p>A property in a class is defined with the below Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where <b>propertyname</b> is the name given to the property.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following is an example of a class in Rexx.</p>

<p>The following points need to be noted about the above program.</p>

<h2>Getter and Setter Methods</h2>

<p>The Getter and Setter methods are used to automatically set and get the values of the properties. In Rexx, when you declare a property with the attribute keyword, the getter and setter methods are already put in place.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above example, there would be Getter and Setter methods for StudentId and StudentName.</p>

<p>An example of how they can be used is shown in the following program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Instance Methods</h2>

<p>Objects can be created from the class via the <b>~new operator</b>. A method from the class can be called in the following way.</p>

<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the method which needs to be invoked from the class.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example shows how an object can be created from a class and the respective method invoked.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Creating Multiple Objects</h2>

<p>One can also create multiple objects of a class. The following example will show how this can be achieved.</p>

<p>In here we are creating 3 objects (st, st1 and st2) and calling their instance members and instance methods accordingly.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of how multiple objects can be created.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>

<p>The class which inherits the properties of other is known as <b>subclass</b> (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as <b>superclass</b> (base class, parent class).</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of inheritance in Rexx. In the following example we are creating a class called <b>Person</b>. From there we use the subclass keyword to create the <b>Student class</b> as a <b>sub-class of Person</b>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
::class classname 
</pre>
<p>where <b>classname</b> is the name given to the class.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
::method methodname 
</pre>

</pre>
<p>The following points need to be noted about the above program.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The name of the class is student.</li>
<li>The class has 2 properties, StudentID and StudentName.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getter and Setter Methods</h2>

<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p>Objects can be created from the class via the <b>~new operator</b>. A method from the class can be called in the following way.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Object~methodname 
</pre>
<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the method which needs to be invoked from the class.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how an object can be created from a class and the respective method invoked.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
value = .student~new 
value~StudentID = 1 
value~StudentName = 'Joe' 
value~Marks1 = 10 
value~Marks2 = 20 
value~Marks3 = 30 
total = value~Total(value~Marks1,value~Marks2,value~Marks3)

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>
<p>The class which inherits the properties of other is known as <b>subclass</b> (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as <b>superclass</b> (base class, parent class).</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of inheritance in Rexx. In the following example we are creating a class called <b>Person</b>. From there we use the subclass keyword to create the <b>Student class</b> as a <b>sub-class of Person</b>.</p>

<title>Rexx Portability</title>

<h1>Rexx - Portability</h1>

<p>Portability is an important aspect in any programming language. As one knows, Rexx is available in a variety of operating systems such as Windows and Linux. So it need to be ensured that when one develops a program on the Windows platform, that it has the necessary precautions taken if the same programs runs on a Linux platform.</p>

<p>Rexx has the ability to run system level commands. There are commands which can be used to understand what is the operating system on which it is running on. Based on the output it can then take the appropriate actions to see what are the commands that can be run on this operating system.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example shows how the parse functions are used to get the details of the operating system on which the program is running.</p>

<p>The output will vary depending on operating system. A sample output is given below.</p>

<title>Rexx Implementations</title>

<h1>Rexx - Implementations</h1>

<p>The Rexx language has a lot of various implementations as we have already seen in the previous chapters. Each implementation has its own functionality. Let’s look at the various implementations available for Rexx.</p>

<h2>OoRexx</h2>

<p>This is the object oriented version of Rexx. By default, the Rexx basic implementation is all based on procedures. But with ooRexx you can offer greater flexibility by having an Object oriented approach to Rexx. By using ooRexx you can have better re-use through creating re-usable classes and objects.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of a simple Rexx program which can be run with the ooRexx implementer.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>To run this program, run the following command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Netrexx</h2>

<p>This is for all Java based developers as it provides a Java based alternative for the Rexx language. So all of the objects are based on the Java Object Model. The advantage of this framework is that since Java is a widely popular language it becomes easier for developers to use this framework. So in this implementation, the Rexx code is converted to a Java program which can then be run on any Java virtual machine.</p>

<p>The following code is an example of a NetRexx program.</p>

<p>Create a file called <b>main.nrx</b> and place the following code in the file.</p>

<p>To compile the code run the following command &minus;</p>

<p>You will then get the following output. NetRexxC is the compiler which converts the Rexx program to its java equivalent.</p>

<p>You can now run your java program using the following java command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Brexx</h2>

<p>This is a lightweight implementation of Rexx. This is a lighter package than the standard Rexx implementer. But it still has the full functionality of Rexx.</p>

<p>The following code is an example of a BRexx program.</p>

<p>To run the program, run the following command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<title>Rexx Databases</title>

<h1>Rexx - Databases</h1>

<p>Rexx has the ability to work with a variety of databases which are listed below.</p>

<p>All the information for Rexx databases can be found once you click on the following link &minus; <a href="https://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>In our example, we are going to use MySQL DB as a sample. So the first step is to ensure to download the required drivers from the Rexx SQL site so that Rexx programs can work with SQL accordingly. So follow the subsequent steps to ensure that Rexx programs can work with MySQL databases.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to the following drivers download page from the Rexx site &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/</a></p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Download the MYSQL drivers - rxsql26B3_my_w32_ooRexx</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Unzip the contents to the local machine.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add the path of the unzipped folder to the path variable on your machine.</p>

<p>For all the subsequent examples, make sure of the following pointers are in place &minus;</p>

<p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p>

<p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p>

<p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p>

<p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p>

<p>Ensure you have downloaded the mysql jar file and added the file to your classpath.</p>

<p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial</p>

<h2>Database Connection</h2>

<p>To establish a database connection, you first need to the Rexxsql DLL and then use the SQLConnect function to establish a connection to the database. The syntax and example of how this can be achieved is given below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>cname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the connection.</p>

<p><b>username</b> &minus; The user name to connect to the database</p>

<p><b>password</b> &minus; The password to connect to the database</p>

<p><b>dbname</b> &minus; The database schema to connect to.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the database connection is successful.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Creating a Database Table</h2>

<p>The next step after connecting to the database is to create the tables in our database. The following example shows how to create a table in the database using Rexx. All of the commands in Rexx SQL are executed by using the SQLCommand function.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>sname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the statement to execute.</p>

<p><b>statement</b> &minus; This is the statement which needs to be executed against the database.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the command was successful.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Operations on a Database Table</h2>

<p>The following types of operations are most commonly performed on a database table.</p>

<p>It is required when you want to create your records into a database table.</p>

<p>A READ Operation on any database means to fetch some useful information from the database.</p>

<p>The UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>

<p>The DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database.</p>

<p>The following command can be used to close a connection to the database.</p>

<h2>Performing Transaction</h2>

<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>

<p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p>

<p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p>

<p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p>

<p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to implement transactions.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Commit Operation</h2>

<p>The commit operation is what tells the database to proceed ahead with the operation and finalize all changes to the database. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>

<h2>Rollback Operation</h2>

<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use rollback method. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
SQLConnect(cname,username,password,dbname) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">

<li><p><b>password</b> &minus; The password to connect to the database</p></li>
<li><p><b>dbname</b> &minus; The database schema to connect to.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the database connection is successful.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
Call RxFuncAdd 'SQLLoadFuncs', 'rexxsql', 'SQLLoadFuncs' 
Call SQLLoadFuncs 
say SQLConnect(c1,' testuser ',' test123','testdb')

</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the command was successful.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */

<h2>Performing Transaction</h2>
<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple example of how to implement transactions.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
Call RxFuncAdd 'SQLLoadFuncs', 'rexxsql', 'SQLLoadFuncs' 
Call SQLLoadFuncs 

if SQLConnect(c1,'testuser','test123','testdb') == 0 then say 'Connect Succedded' 
if SQLCommand(u1,"use testdb") == 0 then say 'Changed database to testdb' 
   sqlstr = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; 20" 

if SQLCommand(c2,sqlstr) == 0 then 
if sqlcommit() == 0 then say committed
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connect Succedded 
Changed database to testdb 
COMMITTED
</pre>
<h2>Commit Operation</h2>
<p>The commit operation is what tells the database to proceed ahead with the operation and finalize all changes to the database. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sqlcommit() 
</pre>
<h2>Rollback Operation</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use rollback method. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SqlRollback() 
</pre>

<title>Rexx Handheld and Embedded Programming</title>

<h1>Rexx - Handheld &amp; Embedded Programming</h1>

<p>Handheld devices have come a long way and Rexx has a lot of ways in which it can run on these devices. Rexx has support for Pocket PC’s, Palm devices, PDA’s and other smart phone devices. The advantage of Rexx to work on these platforms is that Rexx is really a small weight programming system which just runs in the span of a few kilobytes. Hence it becomes easier to run Rexx programs on these devices.</p>

<p>Rexx on handheld devices can run in the following modes &minus;</p>

<p>The first mode is the native node where it runs directly on the operating system itself. The advantage on running in this mode is that it is faster since it runs directly off the operating system.</p>

<p>The next mode is on top of the DOS or emulator program on top of the hand held device. The advantage of this mode is that is can run on any type of operating system as long as the emulator runs on that operating system.</p>

<p>The Rexx Interpreters for the various hand held devices categories are shown below.</p>

<p>For the DOS emulator, the following steps need to be carried out &minus;</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; First is to download PocketDOS which is a popular DOS emulator. It is designed to run on many operating systems and has support for common VGA screens and serial and parallel ports.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to download the BRexx files for 16-bit DOS to a Windows PC.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; The final step is to use ActiveSync to sync the Rexx program to the handheld device.</p>

<p>There are some other commercial DOS based products available. XTM is a product which falls under this category. The features of this product are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Support for the 80186 CPU and instruction set.</p>

<p>It kind of works off the BIOS code for better performance.</p>

<p>It can provide emulation for the Math co-processor, version 8087 MPU</p>

<p>It provides access to the serial ports.</p>

<p>It supports a variety of languages such as English, French and German.</p>

<title>Rexx Performance</title>

<h1>Rexx - Performance</h1>

<p>One of the key aspects of any programming language is the performance of the application. Special practices need to be taken care of to ensure that the application’s performance is not hampered. Let’s look at some of the considerations described in steps for better understanding &minus;</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Try to reduce the number of instructions – In Rexx each instruction carries an overhead. So try to reduce the number of instructions in your program. An example of instructions that can be redesigned is shown below.</p>

<p>Instead of using multiple if else statements one can use the parse statement. So like in the following program, instead of having an if condition for each value, and getting the value of word1, word2, word3 and word4, use the parse statement.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to combine multiple statements into one statement. An example is shown below.</p>

<p>Suppose if you had the following code which did the assignment for – <b>a and b</b> and passed it to a method called <b>proc</b>.</p>

<p>You can easily replace the above given code with the following code using the parse statement.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Try to replace the <b>do..to loop</b> with the <b>do..for loop</b> wherever possible. This is normally recommended when the control variable is being iterated through a loop.</p>

<p>The above program should be replaced by the following program.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; If possible, remove the for condition from a do loop as shown in the following program. If the control variable is not required, then just put the end value in the do loop as shown below.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; In a <b>select clause</b>, whatever u feel is the best condition which will be evaluated needs to put first in the <b>when clause</b>. So in the following example, if we know that 1 is the most frequent option, we put the <b>when 1 clause</b> as the first clause in the select statement.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */  

parse value 'This is a Tutorial' with word1 word2 word3 word4 
say "'"word1"'" 
say "'"word2"'" 
say "'"word3"'" 
say "'"word4"'" 
</pre>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to combine multiple statements into one statement. An example is shown below.</p>
<p>Suppose if you had the following code which did the assignment for – <b>a and b</b> and passed it to a method called <b>proc</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do i = 1 to 100 
a = 0 
b = 1 
call proc a,b 
end
</pre>
<p>You can easily replace the above given code with the following code using the parse statement.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do i = 1 for 100 
parse value 0 1 with 
a, 
b, 
call proc a,b 
end 
</pre>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Try to replace the <b>do..to loop</b> with the <b>do..for loop</b> wherever possible. This is normally recommended when the control variable is being iterated through a loop.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do i = 1 to 10 
say i 
end 
</pre>
<p>The above program should be replaced by the following program.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do i = 1 for 10 
say i 
end
</pre>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; If possible, remove the for condition from a do loop as shown in the following program. If the control variable is not required, then just put the end value in the do loop as shown below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do 10 
say hello 
end
</pre>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; In a <b>select clause</b>, whatever u feel is the best condition which will be evaluated needs to put first in the <b>when clause</b>. So in the following example, if we know that 1 is the most frequent option, we put the <b>when 1 clause</b> as the first clause in the select statement.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
select 
when 1 then say'1' 
when 2 then say'2' 
otherwise say '3'

<title>Rexx Best Programming Practices</title>

<h1>Rexx - Best Programming Practices</h1>

<p>Every programmer wants their program to be the best when it comes to quality and efficiency. The following are some of the best programing practices or hints when writing Rexx programs which can help one achieve these goals.</p>

<h2>Hint 1</h2>

<p>Use the address command before you issue any command to the operating system or command prompt. This will help you get the address space beforehand in memory and cause your program to run more efficiently.</p>

<p>An example of the address command is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the command is as follows, but it could vary from system to system.</p>

<h2>Hint 2</h2>

<p>Ensure all commands to the operating system are in upper case and in quotes wherever possible.</p>

<p>An example for the same is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program, we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Hint 3</h2>

<p>Avoid creating big comment blocks as shown in the following program.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Hint 4</h2>

<p>Use the Parse statement to assign default values. An example for the same is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Hint 5</h2>

<p>Use the "Left(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,1,2)" statement.</p>

<h2>Hint 6</h2>

<p>Use the "Right(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,length(var1),2)" statement.</p>

<title>Rexx Graphical User Interface</title>

<h1>Rexx - Graphical User Interface</h1>

<p>In order to use the graphic user interfaces available in Rexx, one needs to use 2 packages, one is called <b>ActiveTcl</b> and the other is the <b>Rexxtk</b> package. Along with these 2 packages, one can design normal forms which can have buttons and other controls on the forms.</p>

<h2>Environment Setup</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is the environment setup. Let’s go through the following steps to have the environment in place.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Download the Activetcl package from the following website &minus; <a href="https://www.activestate.com/activetcl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.activestate.com/activetcl</a></p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to start the installation of ActiveTCl. Click on the Next button on the screen to proceed.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Accept the license Agreement and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation and click on the next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation of the demo’s and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Click on the Next button to proceed with the installation.</p>

<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Click on the Finish button to complete the installation.</p>

<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; The next step is to download the Rexxtk software from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/</a></p>

<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Double click the installer file from the link in the previous step to start the installation. Click on the next button to proceed.</p>

<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; In the next screen, click on the Yes button to agree to the License Agreement.</p>

<p><b>Step 11</b> &minus; In the next screen, choose the location for the installation and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 12</b> &minus; Choose the Program folder location and click on the next button.</p>

<p>Once the installation is complete, we can now start with programming the GUI’s in Rexx.</p>

<h2>Basic Program</h2>

<p>Let’s see how we can design a simple basic program with Rexx in a graphical user interface format.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The Rexxtk library and all of its functions are loaded using the RxFuncAdd command.</p>

<p>The do forever loop will keep the window open and will wait for the user input.</p>

<p>Once the user input is detected, the program will exit.</p>

<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Creating Menus</h2>

<p>Menus are created with the help of the TkMenu and TkAdd functions. The syntax of these functions are given below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>Widgetname</b> &minus; A name to give to the menu.</p>

<p>Options can be anyone of the following &minus;</p>

<p><b>selectcolor</b> &minus; if checkboxes or radio buttons are used as menu options, then this option specifies the color to choose when any menu option is selected.</p>

<p><b>tearoff</b> &minus; This option is used for adding sub menus to the main menu.</p>

<p><b>title</b> &minus; The string that needs to be used to give the window a title.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A handle to the menu created.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The menubar is created using the TkMenu function. The ‘tearoff’ parameter means that we need to create submenus which is going to be attached to the main menu.</p>

<p>We then add 2 menu options called File and Open using the TkAdd function.</p>

<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
call RxFuncAdd 'TkLoadFuncs','rexxtk','TkLoadFuncs' 
call TkLoadFuncs 
do forever 
interpret 'Call' TkWait() 
end 
call TkDropFuncs 
exit 0 
</pre>
<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The Rexxtk library and all of its functions are loaded using the RxFuncAdd command.</p></li>
<li><p>The do forever loop will keep the window open and will wait for the user input.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user input is detected, the program will exit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>

<title>Rexx Reginald</title>

<h1>Rexx - Reginald</h1>

<p>Reginald is another Rexx interpreter which was developed by Jeff Glantt and has some customizations on how Rexx programs can be run. In this section, we will see how to get Reginald setup and run a few Rexx programs in it.</p>

<h2>Environment Setup</h2>

<p>The first step is the environment setup which is to download the Reginald files. This can be done from the following website link &minus; <a href="https://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm</a></p>

<p>Once the download is complete and you launch the installer, the next screen will allow you to choose the install location.</p>

<p>Click the Install button to proceed.</p>

<p>Once complete, we can now start to run one sample program in the Reginald interpreter. Create a simple program as shown below.</p>

<p>Then run the following command &minus;</p>

<p>You will then get the following output. This program will now be running in the Reginald interpreter.</p>

<h2>Other Functions Available</h2>

<p>Apart from the normal Rexx commands, Reginald had some specific commands that are tailor-made for the Windows operating system. DriveMap is one such command &minus;</p>

<h3>DriveMap</h3>

<p>This function gives information on the drive.</p>

<title>Rexx Web Programming</title>

<h1>Rexx - Web Programming</h1>

<p>Rexx has the facility to work with web servers as well. The most common being the apache web server. In order to use Rexxw with the Apache web server, you need to first download the Rexx modules from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect</a></p>

<p>Once done, make sure to add the mod Rexx modules to the class path.</p>

<p>The following lines need to be added and modified to the Apache configuration file.</p>

<p>The following lines need to be added to the end of the appropriate &minus;</p>

<p>The following lines should be added at the end of the <b>http.conf</b> file.</p>

<p>Once the above changes have been made, you need to shut down and restart your apache web server.</p>

<p>The above lines also allow you to have Rexx based server pages just like Java server pages. You can add the Rexx code directly to the html pages.</p>

<p>An example is shown below &minus;</p>

<p>When a Rexx based server page is run, the following things are carried out &minus;</p>

<p>First a temporary file is created.</p>

<p>Then the Rexx Server compiler compiles the file into a Rexx program and places it in the temporary file.</p>

<p>The next step is to actually run the Rexx program.</p>

<p>Finally, the temporary file is removed.</p>

<title>Rexx Quick Guide</title>

<h1>Rexx - Quick Guide</h1>

<h1>Rexx - Overview</h1>

<p><b>Rexx (Restructured Extended Executor)</b> is designed to be a scripting language. Its goal is to make scripting as easy, fast, reliable, and error-free as possible. Many programming languages are designed for compatibility with older languages, and are written for specific audiences or platforms. Rexx ignores extraneous objectives. It was designed from day one to be powerful, yet easy to use.</p>

<p>Rexx was designed and first implemented, in assembly language, as an 'own-time' project between 20<sup>th</sup> March 1979 and the middle of 1982 by Mike Cowlishaw of IBM, originally as a scripting programming language to replace the languages <b>EXEC and EXEC 2</b>. It was designed to be a <b>macro or scripting language</b> for any system. As such, Rexx is considered a precursor to Tcl and Python. Rexx was also intended by its creator to be a simplified and easier to learn version of the PL/I programming language.</p>

<h2>Features of Rexx</h2>

<p>Rexx as a programming language has the following key features &minus;</p>

<p>Simple syntax</p>

<p>The ability to route commands to multiple environments</p>

<h1>Rexx - Basic Syntax</h1>

<p>In order to understand the basic syntax of Rexx, let us first look at a simple Hello World program.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>One can see how simple the hello world program is. It is a simple script line which is used to execute the Hello World program.</p>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>say command</b> is used to output a value to the console.</p>

<p>The <b>/* */</b> is used for comments in Rexx.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>General Form of a Statement</h2>

<p>In Rexx, let’s see a general form of a program. Take a look at the following example.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<p>Let’s go through what we have understood from the above program &minus;</p>

<p>Add is a function defined to add 2 numbers.</p>

<p>In the main program, the values of 5 and 6 is used as parameters to the add function.</p>

<p>The exit keyword is used to exit from the main program. This is used to differentiate the main program from the add function.</p>

<p>The add function is differentiated with the ‘:’ symbol.</p>

<p>The parse statement is used to parse the incoming arguments.</p>

<p>Finally, the return statement is used to return the sum of the numeric values.</p>

<h3>Subroutines and Functions</h3>

<p>In Rexx, the code is normally divided into subroutines and functions. Subroutines and functions are used to differentiate the code into different logical units. The key difference between subroutines and functions is that functions return a value whereas subroutines don’t.</p>

<p>Below is a key difference example between a subroutine and a function for an addition implementation &minus;</p>

<h3>Function Implementation</h3>

<h3>Subroutine Implementation</h3>

<p>The output of both the programs will be the value 11.</p>

<h2>Executing Commands</h2>

<p>Rexx can be used as a control language for a variety of command-based systems. The way that Rexx executes commands in these systems is as follows. When Rexx encounters a program line which is neither an instruction nor an assignment, it treats that line as a string expression which is to be evaluated and then passed to the environment.</p>

<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Each of the three similar lines in this program is a string expression which adds the name of a file (contained in the string constants) to the name of a command (given as a parameter). The resulting string is passed to the environment to be executed as a command. When the command has finished, the variable "rc" is set to the exit code of the command.</p>

<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Keywords in Rexx</h2>

<p>The free syntax of REXX implies that some symbols are reserved for the language processor's use in certain contexts.</p>

<p>Within particular instructions, some symbols may be reserved to separate the parts of the instruction. These symbols are referred to as keywords. Examples of REXX keywords are the <b>WHILE in a DO instruction</b>, and the <b>THEN</b> (which acts as a clause terminator in this case) following an <b>IF or WHEN clause</b>.</p>

<p>Apart from these cases, only simple symbols that are the first token in a clause and that are not followed by an "=" or ":" are checked to see if they are instruction keywords. You can use the symbols freely elsewhere in clauses without their being taken to be keywords.</p>

<h2>Comments in Rexx</h2>

<p>Comments are used to document your code. Single line comments are identified by using the /* */ at any position in the line.</p>

<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Comments can also be written in between a code line as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<p>You can also have multiple lines in a comment as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - DataTypes</h1>

<p>In any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various types of information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory to store the value associated with that variable.</p>

<p>You may like to store information of various data types like String, Character, Wide Character, Integer, Floating Point, Boolean, etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>

<h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>

<p>Rexx offers a wide variety of built-in data types. Following is a list of data types which are defined in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>Integer</b> &minus; A string of numerics that does not contain a decimal point or exponent identifier. The first character can be <b>a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign</b>. The number that is represented must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647, inclusive.</p>

<p><b>Big Integer</b> &minus; A string of numbers that does not contain a decimal point or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented must be between -9223372036854775808 and 2147483648, inclusive, or between 2147483648 and 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; It will be from one of the following formats &minus;</p>

<p>A string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier. The <b>p</b> represents the precision and <b>s</b> represents the scale of the decimal number that the string represents. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p>A string of numerics that <b>does not contain a decimal point</b> or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented is less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Float</b> &minus; A string that represents a number in scientific notation. The string consists of a series of numerics followed by an exponent identifier (an E or e followed by an optional plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign and a series of numerics). The string can begin with a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p><b>String</b> &minus; A normal string of characters.</p>

<p>Following are some examples of how each data type can be used. Again each data type will be discussed in detail in the subsequent chapters. This is just to get you up to speed with a brief description of the above mentioned data types.</p>

<h3>Integer</h3>

<p>An example of how the number data type can be used is shown in the following program. This program shows the addition of 2 Integers.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h3>Big Integer</h3>

<p>The following program shows the capability of Rexx to handle big integers. This program shows how to add 2 big integers.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h3>Decimal</h3>

<p>The following program shows the capability of Rexx to handle decimal numbers. This program shows how to add 2 decimal numbers.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h3>Float</h3>

<p>The following example show cases how a number can work as a float.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h3>String</h3>

<p>An example of how the Tuple data type can be used is shown in the following program.</p>

<p>Here we are defining a <b>Tuple P</b> which has 3 terms. The <b>tuple_size</b> is an inbuilt function defined in Rexx which can be used to determine the size of the tuple.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Variables</h1>

<p>In Rexx, all variables are bound with the ‘=’ statement. Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘<b>. ! ? _</b>’. A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or a period. A simple variable name does not include a period. A variable name that includes a period is called a compound variable and represents an array or table.</p>

<p>The following are the basic types of variables in Rexx which were also explained in the previous chapter &minus;</p>

<p><b>Integers</b> &minus; This is used to represent an integer or a float. An example for this is 10.</p>

<p><b>Big integers</b> &minus; This represents a large integer value.</p>

<p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; A decimal value is a string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier.</p>

<p><b>Float</b> &minus; A float value is a string that represents a number in the scientific notation.</p>

<p><b>String</b> &minus; A series of characters defines a string in Rexx.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Variable Functions</h2>

<p>In this section, we will discuss regarding the various functions a variable can perform.</p>

<h3>Variable Declarations</h3>

<p>The general syntax of defining a variable is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>var-name</b> &minus; This is the name of the variable.</p>

<p><b>var-value</b> &minus; This is the value bound to the variable.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the variable declaration &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>In the above example, we have 2 variables, one is <b>X</b> which is bound to the value <b>40</b> and the next is <b>Y</b> which is bound to the value of <b>50</b>. Another variable called Result is bound to the addition of <b>X and Y</b>.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Naming Variables</h3>

<p>Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘. ! ? _’ . A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or period.</p>

<p>If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, it is referred to as uninitialized. The value of an uninitialized variable is the name of the variable itself in uppercase letters.</p>

<p>An example of an unassigned variable is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>If you run the above program you will get the following output &minus;</p>

<p>Variables can be assigned values more than once. The below program shows how the value of X can be assigned a value multiple times.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Printing Variables</h3>

<p>The values of variables are printed using the <b>say</b> command. Following is an example of printing a variety number of variables.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Operators</h1>

<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.</p>

<p>Rexx has various types of operators which are also explained in detail as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>The Rexx language supports the normal Arithmetic Operators as any the language. Following are the Arithmetic Operators available in Rexx.</p>

<p><a href="/rexx/rexx_arithmetic_operators.htm" >Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Relational Operators</h2>

<p>Relational Operators allow of the comparison of objects. Following are the relational operators available in Rexx. In Rexx the true value is denoted by 1 and the false value is denoted by 0.</p>

<p><a href="/rexx/rexx_relational_operators.htm">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>Logical Operators are used to evaluate Boolean expressions. Following are the logical operators available in Rexx.</p>

<p><a href="/rexx/rexx_logical_operators.htm" target="_blank">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>

<p>Groovy provides four bitwise operators. Below are the bitwise operators available in Groovy</p>

<p><a href="/rexx/rexx_bitwise_operators.htm" target="_blank">Show Example</a></p>

<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>

<p>The following table shows the Operator Precedence for the Rexx operators in order of descending priority of their precedence.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Arrays</h1>

<p>Arrays in any programming language allow you to group a list of values of the same type. The use of arrays is that it allows you to build a list of similar type of values which are <b>sortable, searchable</b> and can be <b>easily manipulated</b>. Rexx also allows one to define arrays. These arrays can be one dimensional or multidimensional.</p>

<p>Rexx arrays may be sparse. That is, not every array position must have a value or even be initialized. There can be empty array positions, or slots, between those that do contain data elements. Or arrays can be dense, in which consecutive array slots all contain data elements.</p>

<p>In many programming languages, you must be concerned with what the subscript of the first entry in a table is. Is the first numeric subscript 0 or 1? In Rexx, the first subscript is whatever you use! So, input the first array element into position 0 or 1 as you prefer.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Let’s look at the different operations available for arrays.</p>

<h2>Creating Arrays</h2>

<p>Arrays are created with the same naming convention which is used for variables in Rexx.</p>

<p>The general syntax for creating arrays is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>Arrayname</b> &minus; This is the name provided to the array.</p>

<p><b>Index</b> &minus; This is the index position in the array to refer to a specific element.</p>

<p><b>Value</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the index element in the array.</p>

<p>An example of an array declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The following points needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<h2>Assigning Values to an Array Element</h2>

<p>Values can be re-assigned to array elements in the same way as array elements are initialized.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of values which can be assigned to various index values of an existing array.</p>

<h3>Displaying Values of an Array</h3>

<p>The values of an array can be displayed by referring to the index position of the array element. The following example shows to access various elements of the array.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Copying Arrays</h2>

<p>All of the elements of an array can be copied onto another array. The general syntax of this is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>where</p>

<p><b>Newarray</b> &minus; This is the new array in which the elements need to be copied onto.</p>

<p><b>Sourcearray</b> &minus; This is the source array from which the elements need to be copied.</p>

<p>An example on how the copy operations for arrays can be carried out is shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Iterating through array elements</h2>

<p>Elements of an array can also be iterated by using the iterative statements available in Rexx. An example on how this can be done is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The following pointers need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to iterate through the array elements.</p>

<p>The variable <b>number_of_elements</b> is used to store the number of elements in the array.</p>

<p>The <b>variable j</b> is used to iterate through each element of the array.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Two-dimensional Arrays</h2>

<p>It was also mentioned that we can construct multi-dimensional arrays in Rexx. Let’s look at an example of how we can implement a 2-dimensional array.</p>

<p><b>Example</b></p>

<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The following point needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>To create a multidimensional array, we can use another layer of indexing. So in our example, we used <b>list.1.1</b> to create another inner array for the index value 1 of the list array.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Loops</h1>

<p>So far we have seen statements which have been executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Additionally, statements are provided in Rexx to alter the flow of control in a program’s logic. They are then classified into a flow of control statements which we will study in detail.</p>

<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following illustration is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages.</p>

<p>Let us discuss various loops supported by Rexx.</p>

<p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to execute a number of statements for a certain number of times. The number of times that the statement needs to be executed is determined by the value passed to the do loop.</p>

<p>The do-while statement is used to simulate the simple while loop which is present in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The do-until loop is a slight variation of the do while loop. This loop varies in the fact that is exits when the condition being evaluated is false.</p>

<h2>Controlled Repetition</h2>

<p>The do loops can be catered to carry out a controlled repetition of statements.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The general syntax of this sort of statement is as follows.</p>

<p>The difference in this statement is that there is an index which is used to control the number of times the loop is executed. Secondly, there are parameters which state the value which the index should start with, where it should end and what is the increment value.</p>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>Let’s check out the flow diagram of this loop &minus;</p>

<p>From the above diagram you can clearly see that the loop is executed based on the index value and how the index value is incremented.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the controlled repetition statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above program, the value of the <b>count i</b> is set to 0 first. Then it is incremented in counts of 2 till the value is not greater than 5.</p>

<p>The output of the above code will be &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Decision Making</h1>

<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the general form of a typical decision-making structure found in most of the programming languages.</p>

<p>There is a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the various decision-making statements available in Rexx.</p>

<p>The first decision-making statement is the <b>if</b> statement. An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p>

<p>The next decision-making statement is the if-else statement. An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p>

<h2>Nested If Statements</h2>

<p>Sometimes there is a requirement to have <b>multiple if statements</b> embedded inside each other, as is possible in other programming languages. In Rexx also this is possible.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>The flow diagram of nested <b>if</b> statements is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Let’s take an example of nested <b>if</b> statement &minus;</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>

<h2>Select Statements</h2>

<p>Rexx offers the select statement which can be used to execute expressions based on the output of the select statement.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The general form of this statement is &minus;</p>

<p>The general working of this statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>The select statement has a range of when statements to evaluate different conditions.</p>

<p>Each <b>when clause</b> has a different condition which needs to be evaluated and the subsequent statement is executed.</p>

<p>The otherwise statement is used to run any default statement if the previous when conditions do not <b>evaluate to true</b>.</p>

<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>

<p>The flow diagram of the <b>select</b> statement is as follows</p>

<p>The following program is an example of the case statement in Rexx.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Numbers</h1>

<p>Rexx has the following data types when it comes to numbers.</p>

<p><b>Integer</b> &minus; A string of numerics that does not contain a decimal point or exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647, inclusive.</p>

<p><b>Big Integer</b> &minus; A string of numbers that does not contain a decimal point or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented must be between -9223372036854775808 and 2147483648, inclusive, or between 2147483648 and 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; One of the following formats &minus;</p>

<p>A string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier, where <b>p</b> represents the precision and <b>s</b> represents the scale of the decimal number that the string represents. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p>A string of numerics that does not contain a decimal point or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented is less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than 9223372036854775807.</p>

<p><b>Float</b> &minus; A string that represents a number in scientific notation. The string consists of a series of numerics followed by an exponent identifier (an E or e followed by an optional plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign and a series of numerics). The string can begin with a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p>

<p>Let’s now look at the different <b>methods available for numbers</b>.</p>

<p>This method returns the absolute value of an input number.</p>

<p>This method returns the maximum value from a list of numbers.</p>

<p>This method returns the minimum value from a list of numbers.</p>

<p>This method returns a random generated number.</p>

<p>Returns 1 if number is greater than 0, or 0 if the number is 0, or -1 if the number is less than 0.</p>

<p>This method truncates a number.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Strings</h1>

<p>Strings in Rexx are denoted by a sequence of characters. The following program is an example of strings &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Let’s discuss some methods which are available in Rexx for strings.</p>

<p>This method returns a certain number of characters from the left of the string.</p>

<p>This method returns a certain number of characters from the right of the string.</p>

<p>This method returns the number of characters in the string.</p>

<p>This method returns the characters in a reverse format.</p>

<p>This method compares 2 strings. Returns "0" if "string1" and "string2" are identical. Otherwise, it returns the position of the first character that does not match.</p>

<p>This method copies a <b>string n</b> number of times.</p>

<p>This method gets a substring from a particular string.</p>

<p>This method returns the position of one string within another.</p>

<p>This method deletes a substring from within a string.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Functions</h1>

<p>The code in Rexx is normally divided into Functions and Subroutines. Using functions helps in segregating the code into many more logical units. Let’s look at these functions in detail.</p>

<h2>Defining a Function</h2>

<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the function.</p>

<p><b>PARSE ARG</b> &minus; These are keywords in Rexx which are used to mention that parameters are being passed onto the function.</p>

<p><b>arguement1, arguement2… arguementN</b> &minus; These are the arguments passed to the function.</p>

<p><b>Return value</b> &minus; This is the value returned by the function.</p>

<p>The following program is a simple example of how functions are used in Rexx.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a function called add which accepts 2 parameters a and b.</p>

<p>The function uses the return statement to return the sum of a and b.</p>

<p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>

<p>In Rexx, there are specific functions which can be made to work with arguments. Let’s look at a couple of such arguments.</p>

<h3>arg</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the function.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; None</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the number of arguments defined for the function.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>arg(index)</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Index</b> &minus; Index position of the argument to be returned.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Recursive Functions</h2>

<p>A recursive function or routine is one that calls itself. Any recursive function could be coded in a traditional non-recursive fashion (or iteratively), but sometimes recursion offers a better problem solution. Not all programming languages support recursion; Rexx does.</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of the famous factorial program using recursive functions in Rexx.</p>

<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Stacks</h1>

<p>The stack is sometimes called the external data queue, but we follow common usage and refer to it as the stack. It is a block of memory that is logically external to Rexx. Instructions like push and queue place data into the stack, and instructions like pull and parse pull extract data from it. The queued built-in function reports how many items are in the stack.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of a stack.</p>

<p>The first do loop in the program places three lines of data onto the stack. It uses the push instruction to do this. We number the lines so that when they are retrieved in the LIFO order their order is apparent.</p>

<p>The items placed into the stack by the push instruction are retrieved in the LIFO order &minus;</p>

<p>The next code block shows the use of the queued built-in function to discover the number of lines on the stack, as well as a loop to retrieve all the lines from the stack &minus;</p>

<p>Since the three items were placed on the stack via push, they are retrieved in the LIFO order.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>

<h1>Rexx - File I/O</h1>

<p>Rexx provides a number of methods when working with I/O. Rexx provides easier classes to provide the following functionalities for files.</p>

<p>The functions available in Rexx for File I/O are based on both line input and character input and we will be looking at the functions available for both in detail.</p>

<p>Let’s explore some of the file operations Rexx has to offer. For the purposes of these examples, we are going to assume that there is a file called <b>NewFile.txt</b> which contains the following lines of text &minus;</p>

<p>This file will be used for the read and write operations in the following examples. Here we will discuss regarding how to read the contents on a file in different ways.</p>

<h2>Reading the Contents of a File a Line at a Time</h2>

<p>The general operations on files are carried out by using the methods available in the Rexx library itself. The reading of files is the simplest of all operations in Rexx.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the function used to accomplish this.</p>

<h3>linein</h3>

<p>This method returns a line from the text file. The text file is the filename provided as the input parameter to the function.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be read.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns one line of the file at a time.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p>The above code is pretty simple in the fact that the <b>Example.txt</b> file name is provided to the linein function. This function then reads a line of text and provides the result to the variable <b>line_str</b>.</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Reading the Contents of a File at One Time</h2>

<p>In Rexx, reading all the contents of a file can be achieved with the help of the while statement. The while statement will read each line, one by one till the end of the file is reached.</p>

<p>An example on how this can be achieved is shown below.</p>

<p>In the above program, the following things need to be noted &minus;</p>

<p>The lines function reads the <b>Example.txt</b> file.</p>

<p>The while function is used to check if further lines exist in the Example.txt file.</p>

<p>For each line read from the file, the <b>line_str</b> variable holds the value of the current line. This is then sent to the console as output.</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Writing Contents to a File</h2>

<p>Just like reading of files, Rexx also has the ability to write to files. Let’s look at the function which is used to accomplish this.</p>

<h3>lineout</h3>

<p>This method writes a line to a file. The file to which the line needs to be written to is provided as the parameter to the lineout statement.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be written to.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the status of the lineout function. The value returned is 0 if the line was successfully written else the value of 1 will be returned.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Output</b> &minus; Whenever the above code is run, the line “Example4” will be written to the file <b>Example.txt</b>.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Functions For Files</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we will discuss regarding some of the other functions that are available for files.</p>

<p>This function returns either the value 1 or the number of lines left to read in an input stream. The filename is given as the input to the function.</p>

<p>This function is used to check the status of a file. Sometimes it is required to check the status of a file before it is used. If the file is corrupt or not available, then no further operations can be performed on the file. So it makes more sense to first check the status of the file.</p>

<p>This function is used to read one character at a time from a file. Sometimes programs require to read files character wise and hence this function can be used for this purpose.</p>

<p>This function returns either 1 or the number of characters left to read in the file itself. The filename is mentioned as a parameter to the function.</p>

<p>This function is used to write one character at a time to a file. The filename is entered as a parameter to the function.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Subroutines</h1>

<p>In any programming language, the entire program is broken into logical modules. This makes it easier to write code that can be maintained easily. This is a basic requirement for any programming language.</p>

<p>In Rexx, modules can be written using Subroutines and functions. Let’s look at the subroutines in detail.</p>

<h2>Defining a Subroutine</h2>

<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Statement#1 .. Statement#N</b> &minus; These are the list of statements that make up the subroutine.</p>

<p>The following program is a simple example showing the use of subroutines.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a subroutine called <b>add</b>.</p>

<p>The subroutine does a simple add functionality.</p>

<p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>

<p>It is also possible to work with arguments in Rexx. The following example shows how this can be achieved.</p>

<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>We are defining a subroutine called add which takes on 2 parameters.</p>

<p>In the subroutines, the 2 parameters are parsed using the PARSE and ARG keyword.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Different Methods for Arguments</h2>

<p>Let’s look at some other methods available for arguments.</p>

<h3>arg</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; None</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>arg(index)</h3>

<p>This method is used to return the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>

<p><b>Index</b> &minus; Index position of the argument to be returned.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Built-In Functions</h1>

<p>Every programming language has some built-in functions that help the programmer do some routine tasks. Rexx also has a lot of built in functions.</p>

<p>Let’s look at all of these functions available in Rexx.</p>

<p>This method returns the name of the environment in the which the Rexx commands are currently running in.</p>

<p>This method produces a sound in the system at a particular frequency and duration.</p>

<p>This method returns the value of ‘NUM’ if the input is a valid number else it will return the value of ‘CHAR’. You can also specify if you want to compare the input value to a NUM or CHAR value. In each case, the value returned will be either 1 or 0 depending on the result.</p>

<p>This method returns the local date in the following format.</p>

<p>This method returns the current setting of NUMERIC DIGITS as defined in the current system.</p>

<p>This method returns the Rexx error message associated with error number ‘errorno’. Please note that the error number needs to be a value from 0 to 99. This is useful in cases wherein your program returned an error code and you want to know what the error code means.</p>

<p>This method returns the current setting of ‘NUMERIC FORM’ which is used to do mathematic calculations on the system.</p>

<p>This method returns the local time in the 24-hour clock format as shown in the following program.</p>

<p>This method returns the current user id logged into the system.</p>

<p>This method returns the characters in the range specified by the start and end character.</p>

<p>This method returns the decimal conversion of a <b>hexstring value</b>.</p>

<p>This method returns the character conversion of a hexstring value.</p>

<h1>Rexx - System Commands</h1>

<p>One of the biggest advantages in Rexx is the ability to create re-usable scripts. Often in organizations nowadays, having re-usable scripts is a big value add in saving time to do common repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>For example, technology teams in an IT organization can have the need to have scripts which do common everyday tasks. These tasks can include interacting with the operating systems. These scripts can then be programmed to handle bad return codes or errors.</p>

<p>Rexx offers a lot of system commands that can be used to perform such repetitive tasks. Let’s look at some of the system commands available in Rexx.</p>

<h2>dir</h2>

<p>This is the normal directory listing command which is used in Windows.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the current directory listing on the system.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output depends on the directory in the system.</p>

<p>The following program is just an example.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Another example of the <b>dir command</b> is shown in the following program. Only this time we are making use of the <b>special rc variable</b>. This variable is special in Rexx and gives you the status of the execution of system commands. If the value returned is 0, then that means the command is executed successfully. Else the error number will be given in the rc variable name.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h2>Redirection Commands</h2>

<p>Rexx also has the facility of using redirection commands. The following redirection commands are available in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>&lt;</b> &minus; This command is used to take in the input which comes from a file.</p>

<p><b>&gt;</b> &minus; This command is used to output the content to a file. If the file does exist, it will be over-written.</p>

<p><b>&gt;&gt;</b> &minus; This is also used to output the content to a file. But the output is added to the end of the file to preserve the existing content of the file.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example of how we can use redirection commands. In the following example, we are using the sort command to sort a file called <b>sortin.txt</b>. The data from the file is sent to the sort command. The output of the sort command is then sent to the sortout.txt file.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Assume that the file sortin.txt has the following data.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The file <b>sortout.txt</b> will then have the following data.</p>

<h2>The ADDRESS Function</h2>

<p>This method is used to find out what is the default environment used for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>Options for what is the address of a particular system.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the name of the environment for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h1>Rexx - XML</h1>

<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of the operating system and/or developmental language. This is one of the most common languages used for exchanging data between applications.</p>

<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p>The Extensible Markup Language XML is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard. XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring a SQL-based backbone.</p>

<p>For all our XML code examples, let's use the following simple XML file <b>movies.xml</b> for construction of the XML file and reading the file subsequently.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>By default, the xml functionality is not included in the Rexx interpreter. In order to work with XML in Rexx, the following steps need to be followed.</p>

<p>Download the following files &minus;</p>

<p>Rexxxml &minus; <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~ptjm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.interlog.com/~ptjm/</a></p>

<p>Libxml2 &minus; <a href="http://ctindustries.net/libxml/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ctindustries.net/libxml/</a></p>

<p>iconv-1.9.2.win32 &minus; <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/</a></p>

<p>libxslt-1.1.26.win32 &minus; <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/</a></p>

<p>Extract all of the files and ensure they are included in the system path.</p>

<h3>Loading XML Functions</h3>

<p>Once all the files in the above section have been downloaded and successfully registered, the next step is to write the code to load the Rexx XML functions. This is done with the following code.</p>

<p>The following things can be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The function <b>rxfuncadd</b> is used to load external libraries. The <b>xmlloadfuncs</b> function is used to load all the libraries in the <b>rexxxml</b> file into memory.</p>

<p>If the value of rcc&lt;&gt;0, then it would result in an error. For this , we can call the <b>rxfuncerrmsg</b> to give us more details on the error message.</p>

<p>We finally make a call to <b>xmlloadfuncs</b>, so that all xml related functionality can now be enabled in the Rexx program.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the various <b>methods available for XML in Rexx</b>.</p>

<h2>xmlVersion</h2>

<p>This method returns the version of the XML and XSLT libraries used on the system.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>This method returns the version of the XML and XSLT libraries used on the system.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result. This again depends on the version of the XML libraries being used on the system.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h2>xmlParseXML</h2>

<p>This function is used to parse the XML data sent to the function. The document tree is returned by the function.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>Filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the XML file which needs to be parsed.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The document tree is returned by the function. Else returns 0, if there is an error.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>No general output.</p>

<h2>xmlFindNode</h2>

<p>This method evaluates the <b>XPath expression</b> passed to it. This is used for parsing the document tree to result a <b>nodeset</b> which can be processed further.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>XPath</b> &minus; This is the path of the node in the xml file.</p>

<p><b>document</b> &minus; This the XML document</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>Evaluates XPath expression and returns result as a nodeset which can be used later on.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>The output shows the number of movie nodes in our xml list</p>

<h2>xmlEvalExpression</h2>

<p>The below method is used to Evaluate an XPath expression and return a string as a result.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>XPath</b> &minus; This is the path of the node in the xml file.</p>

<p><b>document</b> &minus; The specific node element.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A string is returned based on the XPath expression sent to it.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run above program we will get the following result.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<h1>Rexx - Regina</h1>

<p>Regina is another Rexx interpreter available to compile and run Rexx programs. The official site for Regina is &minus; <a href="http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>Some of the advantages of using Regina are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Regina can run on any platform whether it be Windows, Linux or the Mac OS.</p>

<p>Regina works as per all available standards.</p>

<p>Regina has a big community following and hence there are a lot of forums and learning material available for Regina.</p>

<p>Regina has a lot of tools available for writing and testing Rexx programs.</p>

<p>In Regina, you can run commands which are not possible in the default Rexx Interpreter. For example, if you include certain configuration settings, you can actually run basic system level commands, which is not possible in Rexx.</p>

<p>When you install Rexx via the installation documented in <b>Chapter 2 – Rexx Environment</b>, the Regina interpreter gets installed along with it.</p>

<p>Now let’s see some of the common methods available when using Regina. These functions are the extended functions which are not available via normal use.</p>

<p>To make use of the extended functions, you need to include the following line of code. This enables the use of Regina extended functions.</p>

<p>Secondly while running all Rexx programs, use the following command.</p>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>regina</b> &minus; This is the interpreter used for Rexx programs.</p>

<p><b>main.rexx</b> &minus; Your Rexx program</p>

<p>We will now discuss in detail the various <b>functions of Regina Rexx Interpreter</b>.</p>

<p>This method is used to convert a binary value to a string value.</p>

<p>The method is used to compare 2 bit strings, bit by bit.</p>

<p>This method is used to indicate the state of the specified bit in the bit string.</p>

<p>This method is used to search for the first occurrence of a string in another string.</p>

<p>This method returns the value of an environment variable on the system.</p>

<p>This method is used to get the value of the current running process id.</p>

<p>This method returns the hash attribute of a string as a decimal number. It also updates the internal hash value of the string.</p>

<p>This method is used to add justify or trim the value of a string based on the length value.</p>

<p>This method is used to set the value of an environment variable.</p>

<p>This method gets the value of the current directory on the system.</p>

<p>This method changes the value of the current working directory on the system.</p>

<p>This method returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Parsing</h1>

<p>One of the most powerful features of Rexx is its ability to parse text values. You probably will not see this in any other programming languages.</p>

<p>The general format of the parse statement is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p><b>Where,</b></p>

<p><b>UPPER</b> &minus; The source is converted to upper case before parsing.</p>

<p><b>LOWER</b> &minus; The source is converted to lower case before parsing.</p>

<p><b>CASELESS</b> &minus; When this parameter is passed, the casing is ignored.</p>

<p><b>source</b> &minus; This is the source which needs to be parsed. There are many options available for this and can be any one of the following &minus;</p>

<p><b>ARG</b> &minus; The arguments for the program or procedure can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>LINEIN</b> &minus; The next line input can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>SOURCE</b> &minus; The source information of the program can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>VAR name</b> &minus; The value of a variable name can be used as the source.</p>

<p><b>template</b> &minus; This parameter specifies how to parse the source. There are many options available for this. Some of them are mentioned below.</p>

<p><b>variable name</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the variable.</p>

<p><b>literal string</b> &minus; A literal string which can be used a pattern to split the strung.</p>

<p><b>#</b> &minus; An absolute character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used.</p>

<p><b>&plus;#</b> &minus; A relative character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used relatively.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example of how parsing can be accomplished in Rexx.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above program parses the words in the phrase. When a value consists of words that are separated by only one space, and there are no leading or trailing spaces, the value is easy to parse into a known number of words as follows.</p>

<p>The parse function is used in Rexx to take a string value and then break them down into words. In the above example, the words are then split and then stored in the word variables.</p>

<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Another example of parsing is shown in the following program. This time we are using a while clause to do the parsing.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The above program will give the following output &minus;</p>

<h2>Positional Parsing</h2>

<p>Rexx also allows one to work with positional parsing. Let’s see an example of how we can achieve positional parsing with the parse statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>From the above example, you can note that along with the variable name, we are also specifying where the string should end. So for name1, we should end by the 11th character and then starting parsing name2.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>You can also use <b>relative positional parsing</b> in this case.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Signals</h1>

<p>In Rexx, the signal instruction is used generally for two purposes, which are &minus;</p>

<p>One is to transfer control to another part of the program. This is normally like the go-to label which is used in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The other is to go to a specific trap label.</p>

<p>If the signal command is used in any of the following instruction commands, the pending control structures will automatically be deactivated.</p>

<p>if ... then ... else ...</p>

<p>do ... end</p>

<p>do i = 1 to n ... end [and similar do loops]</p>

<p>select when ... then ... ...etc. otherwise ... end</p>

<p>The general syntax of the signal statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Let’s look at an example of how to use the signal statement.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>If you change the value of the variable n to a whole number as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>You will get the following output &minus;</p>

<p>One can also transfer to the value of the label as shown in the following program &minus;</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Trap Label Transfer Activation / Deactivation</h2>

<p>As we have mentioned earlier, the signal instruction can also be used to transfer control to a trap label.</p>

<p>The general syntax of the Trap label transfer is given as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><b>conditionName</b> &minus; This is the condition for which the signal should be either be turned on or off.</p>

<p><b>Label</b> &minus; The optional label to which the program should be diverted to.</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of using a trap label transfer.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown follows &minus;</p>

<h1>Rexx - Debugging</h1>

<p>Debugging is an important feature in any programming language. It helps the developer to diagnose errors, find the root cause and then resolve them accordingly. In Rexx, the trace utility is used for debugging. The trace instruction can be implemented in 2 ways, one is the batch mode and the other is the interactive mode. Let’s look at how to implement both options.</p>

<h2>Trace in Batch Mode</h2>

<p>The trace command is used to give a detailed level of each Rexx command which is executed.</p>

<p>The general syntax of the trace statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where the setting can be anyone of the following options &minus;</p>

<p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands.</p>

<p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p>

<p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p>

<p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p>

<p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p>

<p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p>

<p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of the trace command.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<p>From the output, you can see that an additional trace was added to the output of the program. The following things can be noted about the output &minus;</p>

<p>The line number along with the statement executed is added to the trace output.</p>

<p>Each line that gets executed is shown in the trace output.</p>

<h2>Trace Function</h2>

<p>Trace can also be enabled with the help of the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The above function returns the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>

<p>The first line of N denotes that the trace is set to Normal.</p>

<h2>Setting Trace Value</h2>

<p>The trace level can be set with the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>trace_level</b> &minus; This is similar to the options available for setting the trace level.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>

<h2>Interactive Tracing</h2>

<p>Interactive tracing is wherein, tracing is carried out as the program runs. Just like in an IDE such as Visual Studio for .Net, in which you can add breakpoints and see how each statement executes, similarly here also you can see the program as each code line runs.</p>

<p>The general syntax is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where, options are the same for the trace command as shown below.</p>

<p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands</p>

<p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p>

<p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p>

<p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p>

<p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p>

<p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p>

<p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of implementing active tracing.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown in the following program. The trace will stop at each line of code; then you need to press the Enter button to move onto the next line of code.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Error Handling</h1>

<p>Rexx has the ability to also work on Error handling as in other programming languages.</p>

<p>The following are some of the various error conditions that are seen in Rexx.</p>

<p><b>ERROR</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in an error.</p>

<p><b>FAILURE</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in a failure.</p>

<p><b>HALT</b> &minus; This is normally raised whenever an operation is dependent on another operation. An example is if an I/O operation is being halted for any reason.</p>

<p><b>NOVALUE</b> &minus; This event is raised when a value has not been assigned to a variable.</p>

<p><b>NOTREADY</b> &minus; This is raised by any I/O device which is not ready to accept any operation.</p>

<p><b>SYNTAX</b> &minus; This event is raised if there is any syntax error in the code.</p>

<p><b>LOSTDIGITS</b> &minus; This event is raised when an arithmetic operation results in a loss of digits during the operation.</p>

<h2>Trapping Errors</h2>

<p>Errors are trapped with the help of the signal command. Let’s take a look at the syntax and an example of this.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><b>Errorcondition</b> &minus; This is the error condition which is given above.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example on this.</p>

<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<p>An example of error codes is shown in the following program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Object Oriented</h1>

<p>When you install ooRexx as per the environment chapter, you will also have the ability to work with classes and objects. Please note that all of the following code needs to be run in the ooRexx interpreter. The normal Rexx interpreter will not be able to run this object oriented code.</p>

<h2>Class and Method Declarations</h2>

<p>A class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>where <b>classname</b> is the name given to the class.</p>

<p>A method in a class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the name given to the method.</p>

<p>A property in a class is defined with the below Syntax declaration.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>Where <b>propertyname</b> is the name given to the property.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following is an example of a class in Rexx.</p>

<p>The following points need to be noted about the above program.</p>

<h2>Getter and Setter Methods</h2>

<p>The Getter and Setter methods are used to automatically set and get the values of the properties. In Rexx, when you declare a property with the attribute keyword, the getter and setter methods are already put in place.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>In the above example, there would be Getter and Setter methods for StudentId and StudentName.</p>

<p>An example of how they can be used is shown in the following program.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Instance Methods</h2>

<p>Objects can be created from the class via the <b>~new operator</b>. A method from the class can be called in the following way.</p>

<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the method which needs to be invoked from the class.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following example shows how an object can be created from a class and the respective method invoked.</p>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Creating Multiple Objects</h2>

<p>One can also create multiple objects of a class. The following example will show how this can be achieved.</p>

<p>In here we are creating 3 objects (st, st1 and st2) and calling their instance members and instance methods accordingly.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of how multiple objects can be created.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

<p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>

<p>The class which inherits the properties of other is known as <b>subclass</b> (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as <b>superclass</b> (base class, parent class).</p>

<p>Let’s see an example of inheritance in Rexx. In the following example we are creating a class called <b>Person</b>. From there we use the subclass keyword to create the <b>Student class</b> as a <b>sub-class of Person</b>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Portability</h1>

<p>Portability is an important aspect in any programming language. As one knows, Rexx is available in a variety of operating systems such as Windows and Linux. So it need to be ensured that when one develops a program on the Windows platform, that it has the necessary precautions taken if the same programs runs on a Linux platform.</p>

<p>Rexx has the ability to run system level commands. There are commands which can be used to understand what is the operating system on which it is running on. Based on the output it can then take the appropriate actions to see what are the commands that can be run on this operating system.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following example shows how the parse functions are used to get the details of the operating system on which the program is running.</p>

<p>The output will vary depending on operating system. A sample output is given below.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Extended Functions</h1>

<p>Rexx provides a number of extended functions that gives a wide variety of functionality, most of them which allow you to interact with the Operating System. Let’s look at some of them in detail as explained below.</p>

<p>This function converts a binary value to a string value.</p>

<p>This function is used to toggle the specified bit in the binary string to 0.</p>

<p>This function is used to compare 2 binary strings starting with bit 0.</p>

<p>This function is used to display the contents of the stack which is normally used in debugging purposes.</p>

<p>This function is used to encrypt a string.</p>

<p>This function is used to spawn a new child process on the system.</p>

<p>This function gets the id of the current running process.</p>

<p>This function returns the hash value of a string.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Instructions</h1>

<p>Rexx provides a number of instructions that gives a wide variety of functionality, most of them which allow you to interact with the Operating System. Let’s look at some of them in detail.</p>

<p>This function is used to display the current command environment.</p>

<p>This function is used to unassign a variable.</p>

<p>Interprets or executes the defined instruction.</p>

<p>This function means to perform no operation. This command is normally used in <b>if statements</b>.</p>

<p>This is used to pull input from the stack or from the default stream.</p>

<p>This is used to push a value onto the Rexx stack.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Implementations</h1>

<p>The Rexx language has a lot of various implementations as we have already seen in the previous chapters. Each implementation has its own functionality. Let’s look at the various implementations available for Rexx.</p>

<h2>OoRexx</h2>

<p>This is the object oriented version of Rexx. By default, the Rexx basic implementation is all based on procedures. But with ooRexx you can offer greater flexibility by having an Object oriented approach to Rexx. By using ooRexx you can have better re-use through creating re-usable classes and objects.</p>

<p>The following program is an example of a simple Rexx program which can be run with the ooRexx implementer.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>To run this program, run the following command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Netrexx</h2>

<p>This is for all Java based developers as it provides a Java based alternative for the Rexx language. So all of the objects are based on the Java Object Model. The advantage of this framework is that since Java is a widely popular language it becomes easier for developers to use this framework. So in this implementation, the Rexx code is converted to a Java program which can then be run on any Java virtual machine.</p>

<p>The following code is an example of a NetRexx program.</p>

<p>Create a file called <b>main.nrx</b> and place the following code in the file.</p>

<p>To compile the code run the following command &minus;</p>

<p>You will then get the following output. NetRexxC is the compiler which converts the Rexx program to its java equivalent.</p>

<p>You can now run your java program using the following java command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Brexx</h2>

<p>This is a lightweight implementation of Rexx. This is a lighter package than the standard Rexx implementer. But it still has the full functionality of Rexx.</p>

<p>The following code is an example of a BRexx program.</p>

<p>To run the program, run the following command.</p>

<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Netrexx</h1>

<p>This command is used to return the entire directory listing.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Databases</h1>

<p>Rexx has the ability to work with a variety of databases which are listed below.</p>

<p>All the information for Rexx databases can be found once you click on the following link &minus; <a href="http://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>In our example, we are going to use MySQL DB as a sample. So the first step is to ensure to download the required drivers from the Rexx SQL site so that Rexx programs can work with SQL accordingly. So follow the subsequent steps to ensure that Rexx programs can work with MySQL databases.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to the following drivers download page from the Rexx site &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/</a></p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Download the MYSQL drivers - rxsql26B3_my_w32_ooRexx</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Unzip the contents to the local machine.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add the path of the unzipped folder to the path variable on your machine.</p>

<p>For all the subsequent examples, make sure of the following pointers are in place &minus;</p>

<p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p>

<p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p>

<p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p>

<p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p>

<p>Ensure you have downloaded the mysql jar file and added the file to your classpath.</p>

<p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial</p>

<h2>Database Connection</h2>

<p>To establish a database connection, you first need to the Rexxsql DLL and then use the SQLConnect function to establish a connection to the database. The syntax and example of how this can be achieved is given below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>cname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the connection.</p>

<p><b>username</b> &minus; The user name to connect to the database</p>

<p><b>password</b> &minus; The password to connect to the database</p>

<p><b>dbname</b> &minus; The database schema to connect to.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the database connection is successful.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Creating a Database Table</h2>

<p>The next step after connecting to the database is to create the tables in our database. The following example shows how to create a table in the database using Rexx. All of the commands in Rexx SQL are executed by using the SQLCommand function.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>sname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the statement to execute.</p>

<p><b>statement</b> &minus; This is the statement which needs to be executed against the database.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the command was successful.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Operations on a Database Table</h2>

<p>The following types of operations are most commonly performed on a database table.</p>

<p>It is required when you want to create your records into a database table.</p>

<p>A READ Operation on any database means to fetch some useful information from the database.</p>

<p>The UPDATE Operation on any database means to update one or more records, which are already available in the database.</p>

<p>The DELETE operation is required when you want to delete some records from your database.</p>

<p>The following command can be used to close a connection to the database.</p>

<h2>Performing Transaction</h2>

<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>

<p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p>

<p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p>

<p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p>

<p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of how to implement transactions.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>

<h2>Commit Operation</h2>

<p>The commit operation is what tells the database to proceed ahead with the operation and finalize all changes to the database. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>

<h2>Rollback Operation</h2>

<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use rollback method. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Handheld &amp; Embedded Programming</h1>

<p>Handheld devices have come a long way and Rexx has a lot of ways in which it can run on these devices. Rexx has support for Pocket PC’s, Palm devices, PDA’s and other smart phone devices. The advantage of Rexx to work on these platforms is that Rexx is really a small weight programming system which just runs in the span of a few kilobytes. Hence it becomes easier to run Rexx programs on these devices.</p>

<p>Rexx on handheld devices can run in the following modes &minus;</p>

<p>The first mode is the native node where it runs directly on the operating system itself. The advantage on running in this mode is that it is faster since it runs directly off the operating system.</p>

<p>The next mode is on top of the DOS or emulator program on top of the hand held device. The advantage of this mode is that is can run on any type of operating system as long as the emulator runs on that operating system.</p>

<p>The Rexx Interpreters for the various hand held devices categories are shown below.</p>

<p>For the DOS emulator, the following steps need to be carried out &minus;</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; First is to download PocketDOS which is a popular DOS emulator. It is designed to run on many operating systems and has support for common VGA screens and serial and parallel ports.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to download the BRexx files for 16-bit DOS to a Windows PC.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; The final step is to use ActiveSync to sync the Rexx program to the handheld device.</p>

<p>There are some other commercial DOS based products available. XTM is a product which falls under this category. The features of this product are as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Support for the 80186 CPU and instruction set.</p>

<p>It kind of works off the BIOS code for better performance.</p>

<p>It can provide emulation for the Math co-processor, version 8087 MPU</p>

<p>It provides access to the serial ports.</p>

<p>It supports a variety of languages such as English, French and German.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Performance</h1>

<p>One of the key aspects of any programming language is the performance of the application. Special practices need to be taken care of to ensure that the application’s performance is not hampered. Let’s look at some of the considerations described in steps for better understanding &minus;</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Try to reduce the number of instructions – In Rexx each instruction carries an overhead. So try to reduce the number of instructions in your program. An example of instructions that can be redesigned is shown below.</p>

<p>Instead of using multiple if else statements one can use the parse statement. So like in the following program, instead of having an if condition for each value, and getting the value of word1, word2, word3 and word4, use the parse statement.</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to combine multiple statements into one statement. An example is shown below.</p>

<p>Suppose if you had the following code which did the assignment for – <b>a and b</b> and passed it to a method called <b>proc</b>.</p>

<p>You can easily replace the above given code with the following code using the parse statement.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Try to replace the <b>do..to loop</b> with the <b>do..for loop</b> wherever possible. This is normally recommended when the control variable is being iterated through a loop.</p>

<p>The above program should be replaced by the following program.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; If possible, remove the for condition from a do loop as shown in the following program. If the control variable is not required, then just put the end value in the do loop as shown below.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; In a <b>select clause</b>, whatever u feel is the best condition which will be evaluated needs to put first in the <b>when clause</b>. So in the following example, if we know that 1 is the most frequent option, we put the <b>when 1 clause</b> as the first clause in the select statement.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Best Programming Practices</h1>

<p>Every programmer wants their program to be the best when it comes to quality and efficiency. The following are some of the best programing practices or hints when writing Rexx programs which can help one achieve these goals.</p>

<h2>Hint 1</h2>

<p>Use the address command before you issue any command to the operating system or command prompt. This will help you get the address space beforehand in memory and cause your program to run more efficiently.</p>

<p>An example of the address command is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The output of the command is as follows, but it could vary from system to system.</p>

<h2>Hint 2</h2>

<p>Ensure all commands to the operating system are in upper case and in quotes wherever possible.</p>

<p>An example for the same is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>When we run the above program, we will get the following result.</p>

<h2>Hint 3</h2>

<p>Avoid creating big comment blocks as shown in the following program.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Hint 4</h2>

<p>Use the Parse statement to assign default values. An example for the same is shown below.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Hint 5</h2>

<p>Use the "Left(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,1,2)" statement.</p>

<h2>Hint 6</h2>

<p>Use the "Right(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,length(var1),2)" statement.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Graphical User Interface</h1>

<p>In order to use the graphic user interfaces available in Rexx, one needs to use 2 packages, one is called <b>ActiveTcl</b> and the other is the <b>Rexxtk</b> package. Along with these 2 packages, one can design normal forms which can have buttons and other controls on the forms.</p>

<h2>Environment Setup</h2>

<p>The first thing to do is the environment setup. Let’s go through the following steps to have the environment in place.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Download the Activetcl package from the following website &minus; <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.activestate.com/activetcl</a></p>

<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to start the installation of ActiveTCl. Click on the Next button on the screen to proceed.</p>

<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Accept the license Agreement and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation and click on the next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation of the demo’s and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Click on the Next button to proceed with the installation.</p>

<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Click on the Finish button to complete the installation.</p>

<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; The next step is to download the Rexxtk software from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/</a></p>

<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Double click the installer file from the link in the previous step to start the installation. Click on the next button to proceed.</p>

<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; In the next screen, click on the Yes button to agree to the License Agreement.</p>

<p><b>Step 11</b> &minus; In the next screen, choose the location for the installation and click on the Next button.</p>

<p><b>Step 12</b> &minus; Choose the Program folder location and click on the next button.</p>

<p>Once the installation is complete, we can now start with programming the GUI’s in Rexx.</p>

<h2>Basic Program</h2>

<p>Let’s see how we can design a simple basic program with Rexx in a graphical user interface format.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The Rexxtk library and all of its functions are loaded using the RxFuncAdd command.</p>

<p>The do forever loop will keep the window open and will wait for the user input.</p>

<p>Once the user input is detected, the program will exit.</p>

<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>

<h2>Creating Menus</h2>

<p>Menus are created with the help of the TkMenu and TkAdd functions. The syntax of these functions are given below.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<p><b>Widgetname</b> &minus; A name to give to the menu.</p>

<p>Options can be anyone of the following &minus;</p>

<p><b>selectcolor</b> &minus; if checkboxes or radio buttons are used as menu options, then this option specifies the color to choose when any menu option is selected.</p>

<p><b>tearoff</b> &minus; This option is used for adding sub menus to the main menu.</p>

<p><b>title</b> &minus; The string that needs to be used to give the window a title.</p>

<h3>Return Value</h3>

<p>A handle to the menu created.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>

<p>The menubar is created using the TkMenu function. The ‘tearoff’ parameter means that we need to create submenus which is going to be attached to the main menu.</p>

<p>We then add 2 menu options called File and Open using the TkAdd function.</p>

<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Reginald</h1>

<p>Reginald is another Rexx interpreter which was developed by Jeff Glantt and has some customizations on how Rexx programs can be run. In this section, we will see how to get Reginald setup and run a few Rexx programs in it.</p>

<h2>Environment Setup</h2>

<p>The first step is the environment setup which is to download the Reginald files. This can be done from the following website link &minus; <a href="http://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm</a></p>

<p>Once the download is complete and you launch the installer, the next screen will allow you to choose the install location.</p>

<p>Click the Install button to proceed.</p>

<p>Once complete, we can now start to run one sample program in the Reginald interpreter. Create a simple program as shown below.</p>

<p>Then run the following command &minus;</p>

<p>You will then get the following output. This program will now be running in the Reginald interpreter.</p>

<h2>Other Functions Available</h2>

<p>Apart from the normal Rexx commands, Reginald had some specific commands that are tailor-made for the Windows operating system. DriveMap is one such command &minus;</p>

<h3>DriveMap</h3>

<p>This function gives information on the drive.</p>

<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus;</p>

<p><b>Options</b> &minus; These are a list of keywords which can be used to get various information on the drives of the local computer.</p>

<p><b>Return Value</b></p>

<p>A string value which has information on the drive.</p>

<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>

<p>If the above program is run, you will get the following output. This output depends from system to system.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Web Programming</h1>

<p>Rexx has the facility to work with web servers as well. The most common being the apache web server. In order to use Rexxw with the Apache web server, you need to first download the Rexx modules from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect</a></p>

<p>Once done, make sure to add the mod Rexx modules to the class path.</p>

<p>The following lines need to be added and modified to the Apache configuration file.</p>

<p>The following lines need to be added to the end of the appropriate &minus;</p>

<p>The following lines should be added at the end of the <b>http.conf</b> file.</p>

<p>Once the above changes have been made, you need to shut down and restart your apache web server.</p>

<p>The above lines also allow you to have Rexx based server pages just like Java server pages. You can add the Rexx code directly to the html pages.</p>

<p>An example is shown below &minus;</p>

<p>When a Rexx based server page is run, the following things are carried out &minus;</p>

<p>First a temporary file is created.</p>

<p>Then the Rexx Server compiler compiles the file into a Rexx program and places it in the temporary file.</p>

<p>The next step is to actually run the Rexx program.</p>

<p>Finally, the temporary file is removed.</p>

<h1>Rexx - Basic Syntax</h1>
<p>In order to understand the basic syntax of Rexx, let us first look at a simple Hello World program.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say "Hello World" 
</pre>
<p>One can see how simple the hello world program is. It is a simple script line which is used to execute the Hello World program.</p>
<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>say command</b> is used to output a value to the console.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>/* */</b> is used for comments in Rexx.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello World
</pre>
<h2>General Form of a Statement</h2>
<p>In Rexx, let’s see a general form of a program. Take a look at the following example.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
parse arg a,b 
return a + b
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
11
</pre>
<p>Let’s go through what we have understood from the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Add is a function defined to add 2 numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>In the main program, the values of 5 and 6 is used as parameters to the add function.</p></li>
<li><p>The exit keyword is used to exit from the main program. This is used to differentiate the main program from the add function.</p></li>
<li><p>The add function is differentiated with the ‘:’ symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>The parse statement is used to parse the incoming arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the return statement is used to return the sum of the numeric values.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Subroutines and Functions</h3>
<p>In Rexx, the code is normally divided into subroutines and functions. Subroutines and functions are used to differentiate the code into different logical units. The key difference between subroutines and functions is that functions return a value whereas subroutines don’t.</p>
<p>Below is a key difference example between a subroutine and a function for an addition implementation &minus;</p>
<h3>Function Implementation</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
parse arg a,b 
return a + b
</pre>
<h3>Subroutine Implementation</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
parse arg a,b 
say a + b
</pre>
<p>The output of both the programs will be the value 11.</p>
<h2>Executing Commands</h2>
<p>Rexx can be used as a control language for a variety of command-based systems. The way that Rexx executes commands in these systems is as follows. When Rexx encounters a program line which is neither an instruction nor an assignment, it treats that line as a string expression which is to be evaluated and then passed to the environment.</p>
<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
parse arg command 
command "file1" 
command "file2" 
command "file3" 
exit 
</pre>
<p>Each of the three similar lines in this program is a string expression which adds the name of a file (contained in the string constants) to the name of a command (given as a parameter). The resulting string is passed to the environment to be executed as a command. When the command has finished, the variable "rc" is set to the exit code of the command.</p>
<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
*-* command "file1"                                        
   &gt;&gt;&gt;   " file1" 
   +++   "RC(127)"
      
   5 *-* command "file2"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;   " file2"
   +++   "RC(127)" 
      
   6 *-* command "file3"
   &gt;&gt;&gt;   " file3"
   +++   "RC(127)" 
</pre>
<h2>Keywords in Rexx</h2>
<p>The free syntax of REXX implies that some symbols are reserved for the language processor's use in certain contexts.</p>
<p>Within particular instructions, some symbols may be reserved to separate the parts of the instruction. These symbols are referred to as keywords. Examples of REXX keywords are the <b>WHILE in a DO instruction</b>, and the <b>THEN</b> (which acts as a clause terminator in this case) following an <b>IF or WHEN clause</b>.</p>
<p>Apart from these cases, only simple symbols that are the first token in a clause and that are not followed by an "=" or ":" are checked to see if they are instruction keywords. You can use the symbols freely elsewhere in clauses without their being taken to be keywords.</p>
<h2>Comments in Rexx</h2>
<p>Comments are used to document your code. Single line comments are identified by using the /* */ at any position in the line.</p>
<p>An example is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */
/* Call the add function */
add(5,6)

/* Exit the main program */
exit add:

/* Parse the arguments passed to the add function */ parse arg a,b
/* Display the added numeric values */
say a + b
</pre>
<p>Comments can also be written in between a code line as shown in the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
/* Call the add function */ 
add(5,6) 

/* Exit the main program */ 
exit 
add: 
parse /* Parse the arguments passed to the add function */ arg a,b 

/* Display the added numeric values */ 
say a + b
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
11
</pre>
<p>You can also have multiple lines in a comment as shown in the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program 
The below program is used to add numbers 
Call the add function */ 
add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
parse arg a,b 
say a + b
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
11
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - DataTypes</h1>
<p>In any programming language, you need to use various variables to store various types of information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory to store the value associated with that variable.</p>
<p>You may like to store information of various data types like String, Character, Wide Character, Integer, Floating Point, Boolean, etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>
<h2>Built-in Data Types</h2>
<p>Rexx offers a wide variety of built-in data types. Following is a list of data types which are defined in Rexx.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Integer</b> &minus; A string of numerics that does not contain a decimal point or exponent identifier. The first character can be <b>a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign</b>. The number that is represented must be between -2147483648 and 2147483647, inclusive.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Big Integer</b> &minus; A string of numbers that does not contain a decimal point or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented must be between -9223372036854775808 and 2147483648, inclusive, or between 2147483648 and 9223372036854775807.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; It will be from one of the following formats &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>A string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier. The <b>p</b> represents the precision and <b>s</b> represents the scale of the decimal number that the string represents. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p></li>
<li><p>A string of numerics that <b>does not contain a decimal point</b> or an exponent identifier. The first character can be a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign. The number that is represented is less than -9223372036854775808 or greater than 9223372036854775807.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Float</b> &minus; A string that represents a number in scientific notation. The string consists of a series of numerics followed by an exponent identifier (an E or e followed by an optional plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign and a series of numerics). The string can begin with a plus (&plus;) or minus (-) sign.</p></li>
<li><p><b>String</b> &minus; A normal string of characters.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Following are some examples of how each data type can be used. Again each data type will be discussed in detail in the subsequent chapters. This is just to get you up to speed with a brief description of the above mentioned data types.</p>
<h3>Integer</h3>
<p>An example of how the number data type can be used is shown in the following program. This program shows the addition of 2 Integers.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">

add(12E2,14E4)  

exit 
add:  

parse arg a,b 
say a + b
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
141200
</pre>
<h3>String</h3>
<p>An example of how the Tuple data type can be used is shown in the following program.</p>
<p>Here we are defining a <b>Tuple P</b> which has 3 terms. The <b>tuple_size</b> is an inbuilt function defined in Rexx which can be used to determine the size of the tuple.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
display("hello")  

exit 
display:  

parse arg a 
say a
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
hello
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Variables</h1>
<p>In Rexx, all variables are bound with the ‘=’ statement. Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘<b>. ! ? _</b>’. A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or a period. A simple variable name does not include a period. A variable name that includes a period is called a compound variable and represents an array or table.</p>
<p>The following are the basic types of variables in Rexx which were also explained in the previous chapter &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Integers</b> &minus; This is used to represent an integer or a float. An example for this is 10.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Big integers</b> &minus; This represents a large integer value.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Decimal</b> &minus; A decimal value is a string of numerics that contains a decimal point but no exponent identifier.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Float</b> &minus; A float value is a string that represents a number in the scientific notation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>String</b> &minus; A series of characters defines a string in Rexx.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Different Types of Variable Functions</h2>
<p>In this section, we will discuss regarding the various functions a variable can perform.</p>
<h3>Variable Declarations</h3>
<p>The general syntax of defining a variable is shown as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
var-name = var-value 
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>var-name</b> &minus; This is the name of the variable.</p></li>
<li><p><b>var-value</b> &minus; This is the value bound to the variable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following program is an example of the variable declaration &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
X = 40 
Y = 50 
Result = X + Y 
say Result
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we have 2 variables, one is <b>X</b> which is bound to the value <b>40</b> and the next is <b>Y</b> which is bound to the value of <b>50</b>. Another variable called Result is bound to the addition of <b>X and Y</b>.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
90
</pre>
<h3>Naming Variables</h3>
<p>Variable names are sometimes referred to as symbols. They may be composed of Letters, Digits, and Characters such as ‘. ! ? _’ . A variable name you create must not begin with a digit or period.</p>
<p>If a variable has not yet been assigned a value, it is referred to as uninitialized. The value of an uninitialized variable is the name of the variable itself in uppercase letters.</p>
<p>An example of an unassigned variable is as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
unassignedvalue 
say unassignedvalue 
</pre>
<p>If you run the above program you will get the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
UNASSIGNEDVALUE: command not found
   2 *-* unassignedvalue 
   &gt;&gt;&gt;   "UNASSIGNEDVALUE" 
   &plus;&plus;&plus;   "RC(127)"
UNASSIGNEDVALUE
</pre>
<p>Variables can be assigned values more than once. The below program shows how the value of X can be assigned a value multiple times.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
X = 40 
X = 50 
say X 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
50
</pre>
<h3>Printing Variables</h3>
<p>The values of variables are printed using the <b>say</b> command. Following is an example of printing a variety number of variables.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
X = 40 

/* Display an Integer */ 
say X 
Y = 50.5 

/* Display a Float */ 
say Y 
Z = "hello" 

/* Display a string */ 
say Z 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
40 
50.5 
hello 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Operators</h1>
<p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations.</p>
<p>Rexx has various types of operators which are also explained in detail as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
<li>Relational operators</li>
<li>Logical operators</li>
<li>Bitwise operators</li>

<h1>Rexx - Arrays</h1>
<p>Arrays in any programming language allow you to group a list of values of the same type. The use of arrays is that it allows you to build a list of similar type of values which are <b>sortable, searchable</b> and can be <b>easily manipulated</b>. Rexx also allows one to define arrays. These arrays can be one dimensional or multidimensional.</p>
<p>Rexx arrays may be sparse. That is, not every array position must have a value or even be initialized. There can be empty array positions, or slots, between those that do contain data elements. Or arrays can be dense, in which consecutive array slots all contain data elements.</p>
<p>In many programming languages, you must be concerned with what the subscript of the first entry in a table is. Is the first numeric subscript 0 or 1? In Rexx, the first subscript is whatever you use! So, input the first array element into position 0 or 1 as you prefer.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
array_name.0 = ‘first element’
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
array_name.1 = ‘first element’
</pre>
<p>Let’s look at the different operations available for arrays.</p>
<h2>Creating Arrays</h2>
<p>Arrays are created with the same naming convention which is used for variables in Rexx.</p>
<p>The general syntax for creating arrays is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Arrayname.index = value 
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Arrayname</b> &minus; This is the name provided to the array.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Index</b> &minus; This is the index position in the array to refer to a specific element.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Value</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the index element in the array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An example of an array declaration is as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 0 
list.2 = 0 
list.3 = 0
</pre>
<p>The following points needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The name of the array is given as list</li>
<li>There are 3 elements of the array which are initialized to the value of 0.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assigning Values to an Array Element</h2>
<p>Values can be re-assigned to array elements in the same way as array elements are initialized.</p>
<p>The following program is an example of values which can be assigned to various index values of an existing array.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 0 
list.2 = 0 
list.3 = 0 

/* Assigning new values to the array*/ 
list.1 = 10 
list.3 = 30 
</pre>
<h3>Displaying Values of an Array</h3>
<p>The values of an array can be displayed by referring to the index position of the array element. The following example shows to access various elements of the array.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 0 
list.2 = 0 
list.3 = 0 

/* Assigning new values to the array*/ 
list.1 = 10 
list.3 = 30 
say list.1 
say list.2 
say list.3 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10
0
30
</pre>
<h2>Copying Arrays</h2>
<p>All of the elements of an array can be copied onto another array. The general syntax of this is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Newarray. = sourcearray. 
</pre>
<p>where</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Newarray</b> &minus; This is the new array in which the elements need to be copied onto.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sourcearray</b> &minus; This is the source array from which the elements need to be copied.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>An example on how the copy operations for arrays can be carried out is shown in the following program &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 0 
list.2 = 0 
list.3 = 0 

/* Assigning new values to the array*/ 
list.1 = 10 
list.3 = 30 
listnew. = list. 

say listnew.1 
say listnew.2 
say listnew.3 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10
0
30
</pre>
<h2>Iterating through array elements</h2>
<p>Elements of an array can also be iterated by using the iterative statements available in Rexx. An example on how this can be done is as follows &minus;</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 10 
list.2 = 20 
list.3 = 30 

number_of_elements = 3 
do j = 1 to number_of_elements 
say list.j 
end 
</pre>
<p>The following pointers need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to iterate through the array elements.</p></li>
<li><p>The variable <b>number_of_elements</b> is used to store the number of elements in the array.</p></li>
<li><p>The <b>variable j</b> is used to iterate through each element of the array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10
20
30
</pre>
<h2>Two-dimensional Arrays</h2>
<p>It was also mentioned that we can construct multi-dimensional arrays in Rexx. Let’s look at an example of how we can implement a 2-dimensional array.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
list.1 = 10 
list.1.1 = 11 
list.1.2 = 12 

say list.1 
say list.1.1 
say list.1.2 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
10
11
12
</pre>
<p>The following point needs to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>To create a multidimensional array, we can use another layer of indexing. So in our example, we used <b>list.1.1</b> to create another inner array for the index value 1 of the list array.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Rexx - Loops</h1>
<p>So far we have seen statements which have been executed one after the other in a sequential manner. Additionally, statements are provided in Rexx to alter the flow of control in a program’s logic. They are then classified into a flow of control statements which we will study in detail.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times. The following illustration is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/loop.jpg" alt="Loop" />
<p>Let us discuss various loops supported by Rexx.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Loop Type &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_do_loop.htm">do loop</a>
<p>The <b>do loop</b> is used to execute a number of statements for a certain number of times. The number of times that the statement needs to be executed is determined by the value passed to the do loop.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_do_while_loop.htm">do-while loop</a>
<p>The do-while statement is used to simulate the simple while loop which is present in other programming languages.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">3</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_do_until_loop.htm">do-until loop</a>
<p>The do-until loop is a slight variation of the do while loop. This loop varies in the fact that is exits when the condition being evaluated is false.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Controlled Repetition</h2>
<p>The do loops can be catered to carry out a controlled repetition of statements.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The general syntax of this sort of statement is as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
do index = start [to limit] [by increment] [for count] 
statement #1 
statement #2 
end 
</pre>
<p>The difference in this statement is that there is an index which is used to control the number of times the loop is executed. Secondly, there are parameters which state the value which the index should start with, where it should end and what is the increment value.</p>
<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>Let’s check out the flow diagram of this loop &minus;</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/controlled_repetition.jpg" alt="Controlled Repetition" />
<p>From the above diagram you can clearly see that the loop is executed based on the index value and how the index value is incremented.</p>
<p>The following program is an example of the controlled repetition statement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
do i = 0 to 5 by 2 
   say "hello" 
end 
</pre>
<p>In the above program, the value of the <b>count i</b> is set to 0 first. Then it is incremented in counts of 2 till the value is not greater than 5.</p>
<p>The output of the above code will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
hello 
hello 
hello 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Decision Making</h1>
<p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the general form of a typical decision-making structure found in most of the programming languages.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/decision_making.jpg" alt="Decision Making" />
<p>There is a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>true</b>, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be <b>false</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the various decision-making statements available in Rexx.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Statement &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">1</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_if_statement.htm">If statement</a>
<p>The first decision-making statement is the <b>if</b> statement. An <b>if</b> statement consists of a Boolean expression followed by one or more statements.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;">2</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_if_else_statement.htm">If-else statement</a>
<p>The next decision-making statement is the if-else statement. An <b>if</b> statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Nested If Statements</h2>
<p>Sometimes there is a requirement to have <b>multiple if statements</b> embedded inside each other, as is possible in other programming languages. In Rexx also this is possible.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
if (condition1) then 
   do 
      #statement1 
   end 
else 
   if (condition2) then 
      do 
      #statement2 
   end
</pre>
<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>The flow diagram of nested <b>if</b> statements is as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/nested_if_statement.jpg" alt="Nested If Statement" />
<p>Let’s take an example of nested <b>if</b> statement &minus;</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
i = 50 
if (i &lt; 10) then 
   do 
      say "i is less than 10" 
   end 
else 
if (i &lt; 7) then 
   do 
      say "i is less than 7" 
   end 
else 
   do 
      say "i is greater than 10" 
   end 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
i is greater than 10 
</pre>
<h2>Select Statements</h2>
<p>Rexx offers the select statement which can be used to execute expressions based on the output of the select statement.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The general form of this statement is &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
select 
when (condition#1) then 
statement#1 

when (condition#2) then 
statement#2 
otherwise 

defaultstatement 
end 
</pre>
<p>The general working of this statement is as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The select statement has a range of when statements to evaluate different conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Each <b>when clause</b> has a different condition which needs to be evaluated and the subsequent statement is executed.</p></li>
<li><p>The otherwise statement is used to run any default statement if the previous when conditions do not <b>evaluate to true</b>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>The flow diagram of the <b>select</b> statement is as follows</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/select_statement.jpg" alt="Select Statement" />
<p>The following program is an example of the case statement in Rexx.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
i = 50 
select 
when(i &lt;= 5) then 
say "i is less than 5" 

when(i &lt;= 10) then 
say "i is less than 10" 

otherwise 
say "i is greater than 10" 
end

<h1>Rexx - Functions</h1>
<p>The code in Rexx is normally divided into Functions and Subroutines. Using functions helps in segregating the code into many more logical units. Let’s look at these functions in detail.</p>
<h2>Defining a Function</h2>
<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
FunctionName: 
PARSE ARG arguement1, arguement2… arguementN 
Return value 
</pre>
<p><b>Where,</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the function.</p></li>
<li><p><b>PARSE ARG</b> &minus; These are keywords in Rexx which are used to mention that parameters are being passed onto the function.</p></li>
<li><p><b>arguement1, arguement2… arguementN</b> &minus; These are the arguments passed to the function.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Return value</b> &minus; This is the value returned by the function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following program is a simple example of how functions are used in Rexx.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 
return a + b 
</pre>
<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>We are defining a function called add which accepts 2 parameters a and b.</p></li>
<li><p>The function uses the return statement to return the sum of a and b.</p></li>
<li><p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
11
</pre>
<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>
<p>In Rexx, there are specific functions which can be made to work with arguments. Let’s look at a couple of such arguments.</p>
<h3>arg</h3>
<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the function.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
arg() 
</pre>
<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; None</p>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the number of arguments defined for the function.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 

say arg() 
return a + b 
</pre>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
2 
11 
</pre>
<h3>arg(index)</h3>
<p>This method is used to return the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
arg(index)
</pre>
<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Index</b> &minus; Index position of the argument to be returned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say add(5,6) 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 

say arg(1) 
return a + b 
</pre>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
5 
11 
</pre>
<h2>Recursive Functions</h2>
<p>A recursive function or routine is one that calls itself. Any recursive function could be coded in a traditional non-recursive fashion (or iteratively), but sometimes recursion offers a better problem solution. Not all programming languages support recursion; Rexx does.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of the famous factorial program using recursive functions in Rexx.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
do n = 1 to 5 
say 'The factorial of' n 'is:' factorial( n ) 
end 
return  

/* Function to get factorial */ 
factorial : procedure 
n = arg(1) 
if n = 1 then 
return 1 
return n * factorial( n - 1 ) 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The factorial of 1 is: 1
The factorial of 2 is: 2 
The factorial of 3 is: 6 
The factorial of 3 is: 24 
The factorial of 3 is: 120 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Stacks</h1>
<p>The stack is sometimes called the external data queue, but we follow common usage and refer to it as the stack. It is a block of memory that is logically external to Rexx. Instructions like push and queue place data into the stack, and instructions like pull and parse pull extract data from it. The queued built-in function reports how many items are in the stack.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of a stack.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* STACK: */
/* */ 
/* This program shows how to use the Rexx Stack as either a */ 

/* stack or a queue. */ 
do j = 1 to 3 
push ‘Stack: line #’ || j 

/* push 3 lines onto the stack */ 
end 
do j = 1 to queued() 

/* retrieve and display LIFO */ 
pull line 
say line 
end 
do j = 1 to 3 queue ‘Queue: line #’ || j 

/* queue 3 lines onto the stack */ 
end 
do queued() 

/* retrieve and display FIFO */ 
pull line 
say line 
end 
exit 0
</pre>
<p>The first do loop in the program places three lines of data onto the stack. It uses the push instruction to do this. We number the lines so that when they are retrieved in the LIFO order their order is apparent.</p>
<p>The items placed into the stack by the push instruction are retrieved in the LIFO order &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do j = 1 to 3 
push ‘Stack: line #’ || j /* push 3 lines onto the stack */ 
end
</pre>
<p>The next code block shows the use of the queued built-in function to discover the number of lines on the stack, as well as a loop to retrieve all the lines from the stack &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do j = 1 to queued()  /* retrieve and display LIFO */ 
pull line 
say line 
end
</pre>
<p>Since the three items were placed on the stack via push, they are retrieved in the LIFO order.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
STACK: LINE #3 
STACK: LINE #2 
STACK: LINE #1   
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - File I/O</h1>
<p>Rexx provides a number of methods when working with I/O. Rexx provides easier classes to provide the following functionalities for files.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Reading files</li>
<li>Writing to files</li>
<li>Seeing whether a file is a file or directory</li>
</ul>
<p>The functions available in Rexx for File I/O are based on both line input and character input and we will be looking at the functions available for both in detail.</p>
<p>Let’s explore some of the file operations Rexx has to offer. For the purposes of these examples, we are going to assume that there is a file called <b>NewFile.txt</b> which contains the following lines of text &minus;</p>
<p style="padding-left:10%"><b>Example1</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:10%"><b>Example2</b></p>
<p style="padding-left:10%"><b>Example3</b></p>
<p>This file will be used for the read and write operations in the following examples. Here we will discuss regarding how to read the contents on a file in different ways.</p>
<h2>Reading the Contents of a File a Line at a Time</h2>
<p>The general operations on files are carried out by using the methods available in the Rexx library itself. The reading of files is the simplest of all operations in Rexx.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the function used to accomplish this.</p>
<h3>linein</h3>
<p>This method returns a line from the text file. The text file is the filename provided as the input parameter to the function.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
linein(filename) 
</pre>
<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be read.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns one line of the file at a time.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
line_str = linein(Example.txt) 
say line_str
</pre>
<p>The above code is pretty simple in the fact that the <b>Example.txt</b> file name is provided to the linein function. This function then reads a line of text and provides the result to the variable <b>line_str</b>.</p>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Example1
</pre>
<h2>Reading the Contents of a File at One Time</h2>
<p>In Rexx, reading all the contents of a file can be achieved with the help of the while statement. The while statement will read each line, one by one till the end of the file is reached.</p>
<p>An example on how this can be achieved is shown below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do while lines(Example.txt) > 0  
line_str = linein(Example.txt) 
say line_str 
end 
</pre>
<p>In the above program, the following things need to be noted &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The lines function reads the <b>Example.txt</b> file.</p></li>
<li><p>The while function is used to check if further lines exist in the Example.txt file.</p></li>
<li><p>For each line read from the file, the <b>line_str</b> variable holds the value of the current line. This is then sent to the console as output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Example1 
Example2 
Example3 
</pre>
<h2>Writing Contents to a File</h2>
<p>Just like reading of files, Rexx also has the ability to write to files. Let’s look at the function which is used to accomplish this.</p>
<h3>lineout</h3>
<p>This method writes a line to a file. The file to which the line needs to be written to is provided as the parameter to the lineout statement.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
lineout(filename) 
</pre>
<p><b>Parameter</b> &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>filename</b> &minus; This is the name of the file from where the line needs to be written to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the status of the lineout function. The value returned is 0 if the line was successfully written else the value of 1 will be returned.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
out = lineout(Example.txt,"Example4") 
</pre>
<p><b>Output</b> &minus; Whenever the above code is run, the line “Example4” will be written to the file <b>Example.txt</b>.</p>
<h1>Rexx - Functions For Files</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will discuss regarding some of the other functions that are available for files.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Functions for Files</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">1</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_lines.htm">Lines</a>
<p>This function returns either the value 1 or the number of lines left to read in an input stream. The filename is given as the input to the function.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">2</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_stream.htm">stream</a>
<p>This function is used to check the status of a file. Sometimes it is required to check the status of a file before it is used. If the file is corrupt or not available, then no further operations can be performed on the file. So it makes more sense to first check the status of the file.</p></td>

<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">3</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_charin.htm">charin</a>
<p>This function is used to read one character at a time from a file. Sometimes programs require to read files character wise and hence this function can be used for this purpose.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:middle">4</td>
<td><a href="/rexx/rexx_chars.htm">chars</a>

<h1>Rexx - Subroutines</h1>
<p>In any programming language, the entire program is broken into logical modules. This makes it easier to write code that can be maintained easily. This is a basic requirement for any programming language.</p>
<p>In Rexx, modules can be written using Subroutines and functions. Let’s look at the subroutines in detail.</p>
<h2>Defining a Subroutine</h2>
<p>The syntax of a function declaration is as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
FunctionName: 
   Statement#1 
   Statement#2 
   …. 
   Statement#N
</pre>
<p><b>Where,</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>FunctionName</b> &minus; This is the name assigned to the subroutine.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Statement#1 .. Statement#N</b> &minus; These are the list of statements that make up the subroutine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following program is a simple example showing the use of subroutines.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
call add 
exit 
add: 
a = 5 
b = 10 
c = a + b 
say c 
</pre>
<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>We are defining a subroutine called <b>add</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>The subroutine does a simple add functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>The exit statement has to be used to signify the end of the main program.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
15
</pre>
<h2>Working with Arguments</h2>
<p>It is also possible to work with arguments in Rexx. The following example shows how this can be achieved.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
call add 1,2 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 
c = a + b 
say c
</pre>
<p>The following things should be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>We are defining a subroutine called add which takes on 2 parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>In the subroutines, the 2 parameters are parsed using the PARSE and ARG keyword.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
3
</pre>
<h2>Different Methods for Arguments</h2>
<p>Let’s look at some other methods available for arguments.</p>
<h3>arg</h3>
<p>This method is used to return the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
arg() 
</pre>
<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus; None</p>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the number of arguments defined for the subroutine.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
call add 1,2 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 

say arg() 
c = a + b 
say c 
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
2 
3 
</pre>
<h3>arg(index)</h3>
<p>This method is used to return the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
arg(index)
</pre>
<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Index</b> &minus; Index position of the argument to be returned.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Return Value</b> &minus; This method returns the value of the argument at the specific position.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
call add 1,2 
exit 
add: 
PARSE ARG a,b 

say arg(1) 
c = a + b 
say c

<h1>Rexx - System Commands</h1>
<p>One of the biggest advantages in Rexx is the ability to create re-usable scripts. Often in organizations nowadays, having re-usable scripts is a big value add in saving time to do common repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>For example, technology teams in an IT organization can have the need to have scripts which do common everyday tasks. These tasks can include interacting with the operating systems. These scripts can then be programmed to handle bad return codes or errors.</p>
<p>Rexx offers a lot of system commands that can be used to perform such repetitive tasks. Let’s look at some of the system commands available in Rexx.</p>
<h2>dir</h2>
<p>This is the normal directory listing command which is used in Windows.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
dir
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>This method returns the current directory listing on the system.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
dir 
</pre>
<p>The output depends on the directory in the system.</p>
<p>The following program is just an example.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">

               7 Dir(s)     202,567,680 bytes free 
</pre>
<p>Another example of the <b>dir command</b> is shown in the following program. Only this time we are making use of the <b>special rc variable</b>. This variable is special in Rexx and gives you the status of the execution of system commands. If the value returned is 0, then that means the command is executed successfully. Else the error number will be given in the rc variable name.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
dir 
if rc = 0 then 
   say 'The command executed successfully' 
else 
   say 'The command failed, The error code is =' rc 
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The command executed successfully. 
</pre>
<h2>Redirection Commands</h2>
<p>Rexx also has the facility of using redirection commands. The following redirection commands are available in Rexx.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>&lt;</b> &minus; This command is used to take in the input which comes from a file.</p></li>
<li><p><b>&gt;</b> &minus; This command is used to output the content to a file. If the file does exist, it will be over-written.</p></li>
<li><p><b>&gt;&gt;</b> &minus; This is also used to output the content to a file. But the output is added to the end of the file to preserve the existing content of the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at an example of how we can use redirection commands. In the following example, we are using the sort command to sort a file called <b>sortin.txt</b>. The data from the file is sent to the sort command. The output of the sort command is then sent to the sortout.txt file.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit" title="sortout.txt">
/* Main program */ 
'sort &lt;sortin.txt&gt; sortout.txt' 
</pre>
<p>Assume that the file sortin.txt has the following data.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
b 
c 
a
</pre>
<p>The file <b>sortout.txt</b> will then have the following data.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate" id="sortout.txt">
a 
b 
c 
</pre>
<h2>The ADDRESS Function</h2>
<p>This method is used to find out what is the default environment used for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ADDRESS(options) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Options for what is the address of a particular system.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>This method returns the name of the environment for the Input, Error and Output streams.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say ADDRESS('I') 
say ADDRESS('O') 
say ADDRESS('E')
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program we will get the following result.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
INPUT NORMAL

<h1>Rexx - XML</h1>
<p>XML is a portable, open source language that allows programmers to develop applications that can be read by other applications, regardless of the operating system and/or developmental language. This is one of the most common languages used for exchanging data between applications.</p>
<h2>What is XML?</h2>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language XML is a markup language much like HTML or SGML. This is recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium and available as an open standard. XML is extremely useful for keeping track of small to medium amounts of data without requiring a SQL-based backbone.</p>
<p>For all our XML code examples, let's use the following simple XML file <b>movies.xml</b> for construction of the XML file and reading the file subsequently.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;collection shelf = "New Arrivals"&gt; 
   &lt;movie title = "Enemy Behind"&gt;

      &lt;format&gt;VHS&lt;/format&gt; 
      &lt;year&gt;1987&lt;/year&gt; 
      &lt;rating&gt;PG&lt;/rating&gt; 
      &lt;stars&gt;2&lt;/stars&gt; 
      &lt;description&gt;Viewable boredom &lt;/description&gt; 
   &lt;/movie&gt; 
&lt;/collection&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>By default, the xml functionality is not included in the Rexx interpreter. In order to work with XML in Rexx, the following steps need to be followed.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Download the following files &minus;</p> 
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Rexxxml &minus; <a href="http://www.interlog.com/~ptjm/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.interlog.com/~ptjm/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Libxml2 &minus; <a href="http://ctindustries.net/libxml/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.ctindustries.net/libxml/</a></p></li>
<li><p>iconv-1.9.2.win32 &minus; <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.xmlsoft.org/sources/win32/oldreleases/</a></p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Extract all of the files and ensure they are included in the system path.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Loading XML Functions</h3>
<p>Once all the files in the above section have been downloaded and successfully registered, the next step is to write the code to load the Rexx XML functions. This is done with the following code.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
rcc = rxfuncadd('XMLLoadFuncs', 'rexxxml', 'xmlloadfuncs') 

if rcc then do 
   say rxfuncerrmsg() 
   exit 1 
end 
call xmlloadfuncs
</pre>
<p>The following things can be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The function <b>rxfuncadd</b> is used to load external libraries. The <b>xmlloadfuncs</b> function is used to load all the libraries in the <b>rexxxml</b> file into memory.</p></li>

<h1>Rexx - Regina</h1>
<p>Regina is another Rexx interpreter available to compile and run Rexx programs. The official site for Regina is &minus; <a href="http://regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.regina-rexx.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<img src="/rexx/images/regina_rexx_interpreter.jpg" alt="Regina Rexx Interpreter" />
<p>Some of the advantages of using Regina are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Regina can run on any platform whether it be Windows, Linux or the Mac OS.</p></li>
<li><p>Regina works as per all available standards.</p></li>
<li><p>Regina has a big community following and hence there are a lot of forums and learning material available for Regina.</p></li>
<li><p>Regina has a lot of tools available for writing and testing Rexx programs.</p></li>
<li><p>In Regina, you can run commands which are not possible in the default Rexx Interpreter. For example, if you include certain configuration settings, you can actually run basic system level commands, which is not possible in Rexx.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you install Rexx via the installation documented in <b>Chapter 2 – Rexx Environment</b>, the Regina interpreter gets installed along with it.</p>
<p>Now let’s see some of the common methods available when using Regina. These functions are the extended functions which are not available via normal use.</p>
<p>To make use of the extended functions, you need to include the following line of code. This enables the use of Regina extended functions.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
options arexx_bifs 
</pre>
<p>Secondly while running all Rexx programs, use the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>Rexx - Parsing</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful features of Rexx is its ability to parse text values. You probably will not see this in any other programming languages.</p>
<p>The general format of the parse statement is as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
PARSE {UPPER|LOWER|CASELESS} source {template} 
</pre>
<p><b>Where,</b></p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>UPPER</b> &minus; The source is converted to upper case before parsing.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LOWER</b> &minus; The source is converted to lower case before parsing.</p></li>
<li><p><b>CASELESS</b> &minus; When this parameter is passed, the casing is ignored.</p></li>
<li><p><b>source</b> &minus; This is the source which needs to be parsed. There are many options available for this and can be any one of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>ARG</b> &minus; The arguments for the program or procedure can be used as the source.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LINEIN</b> &minus; The next line input can be used as the source.</p></li>
<li><p><b>SOURCE</b> &minus; The source information of the program can be used as the source.</p></li>
<li><p><b>VAR name</b> &minus; The value of a variable name can be used as the source.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>template</b> &minus; This parameter specifies how to parse the source. There are many options available for this. Some of them are mentioned below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>variable name</b> &minus; This is the value assigned to the variable.</p></li>
<li><p><b>literal string</b> &minus; A literal string which can be used a pattern to split the strung.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>#</b> &minus; An absolute character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>&plus;#</b> &minus; A relative character position within the source itself. So if you specify a value of 5, the 5<sup>th</sup> character will be used relatively.</p></li> 
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at a simple example of how parsing can be accomplished in Rexx.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
parse value 'This is a Tutorial' with word1 word2 word3 word4 
say "'"word1"'" 
say "'"word2"'" 
say "'"word3"'" 
say "'"word4"'" 
</pre>
<p>The above program parses the words in the phrase. When a value consists of words that are separated by only one space, and there are no leading or trailing spaces, the value is easy to parse into a known number of words as follows.</p>
<p>The parse function is used in Rexx to take a string value and then break them down into words. In the above example, the words are then split and then stored in the word variables.</p>
<p>The output of the above program would be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
'This' 
'is' 
'a' 
'Tutorial' 
</pre>
<p>Another example of parsing is shown in the following program. This time we are using a while clause to do the parsing.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
phrase = 'This is a Tutorial' 

do while phrase &lt;&gt; '' 
   parse var phrase word phrase 
   say "'"word"'" 
   end 
</pre>
<p>The above program will give the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
'This' 
'is' 
'a' 
'Tutorial' 
</pre>
<h2>Positional Parsing</h2>
<p>Rexx also allows one to work with positional parsing. Let’s see an example of how we can achieve positional parsing with the parse statement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
testString = "Doe       John M.   03/03/78  Mumbai              India"; 
parse var testString name1 11 name2 21 birthday 31 town 51 country 
say name1 
say name2 
say birthday 
say town 
say country
</pre>
<p>From the above example, you can note that along with the variable name, we are also specifying where the string should end. So for name1, we should end by the 11th character and then starting parsing name2.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Doe 
John M. 
03/03/78 
Mumbai 
India
</pre>
<p>You can also use <b>relative positional parsing</b> in this case.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
testString = "Doe       John M.   03/03/78  Mumbai              India"; 
parse var testString name1 +10 name2 +10 birthday +10 town +20 country 
say name1 
say name2 
say birthday 
say town 
say country
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Doe 
John M. 
03/03/78 
Mumbai 
India 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Signals</h1>
<p>In Rexx, the signal instruction is used generally for two purposes, which are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>One is to transfer control to another part of the program. This is normally like the go-to label which is used in other programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p>The other is to go to a specific trap label.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the signal command is used in any of the following instruction commands, the pending control structures will automatically be deactivated.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>if ... then ... else ...</p></li>
<li><p>do ... end</p></li>
<li><p>do i = 1 to n ... end [and similar do loops]</p></li>
<li><p>select when ... then ... ...etc. otherwise ... end</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The general syntax of the signal statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
signal labelName  
   
signal [ VALUE ] labelExpression 
</pre>
<p>Let’s look at an example of how to use the signal statement.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
n = 100.45 

if \ datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
   signal msg 
   say 'This is a whole number' 
   return 0 
msg : 
   say 'This is an incorrect number'
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is an incorrect number.
</pre>
<p>If you change the value of the variable n to a whole number as shown in the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
n = 100 

if \ datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
   signal msg 
   say ' This is a whole number ' 
   return 0 
msg : 
   say ' This is an incorrect number ' 
</pre>
<p>You will get the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is a whole number
</pre>
<p>One can also transfer to the value of the label as shown in the following program &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
n = 1 

if \ datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
   signal msg 

if n &lt; 1 | n &gt; 3 then 
   signal msg  
   signal value n 
   3 : say 'This is the number 3' 
   2 : say ' This is the number 2' 
   1 : say ' This is the number 1' 
   return n 
msg : 
   say ' This is an incorrect number ' 
   exit 99 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be shown as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
This is the number 1
</pre>
<h2>Trap Label Transfer Activation / Deactivation</h2>
<p>As we have mentioned earlier, the signal instruction can also be used to transfer control to a trap label.</p>
<p>The general syntax of the Trap label transfer is given as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
signal ON conditionName [ NAME Label ] 
  
signal OFF conditionName
</pre>
<p>Where,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>conditionName</b> &minus; This is the condition for which the signal should be either be turned on or off.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Label</b> &minus; The optional label to which the program should be diverted to.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s see an example of using a trap label transfer.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
signal on error 
signal on failure 
signal on syntax 
signal on novalue 
beep(1) 
signal off error 
signal off failure 
signal off syntax 
signal off novalue 
exit 0 
error: failure: syntax: novalue: 
say 'An error has occured' 
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
An error has occurred.
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Debugging</h1>
<p>Debugging is an important feature in any programming language. It helps the developer to diagnose errors, find the root cause and then resolve them accordingly. In Rexx, the trace utility is used for debugging. The trace instruction can be implemented in 2 ways, one is the batch mode and the other is the interactive mode. Let’s look at how to implement both options.</p>
<h2>Trace in Batch Mode</h2>
<p>The trace command is used to give a detailed level of each Rexx command which is executed.</p>
<p>The general syntax of the trace statement is shown as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
trace [setting] 
</pre>
<p>Where the setting can be anyone of the following options &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of the trace command.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
trace A 

/* Main program */ 
n = 100.45 if datatype( n, wholenumber ) then signal msg 

say 'This is a whole number' 
return 0 

msg : 
   say ' This is an incorrect number ' 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
5 *-* n = 100.45 if datatype( n, wholenumber ) then signal msg
   7 *-* say 'This is a whole number
This is a whole number                                                   
   8 *-* return 0
</pre>
<p>From the output, you can see that an additional trace was added to the output of the program. The following things can be noted about the output &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The line number along with the statement executed is added to the trace output.</p></li>
<li><p>Each line that gets executed is shown in the trace output.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Trace Function</h2>
<p>Trace can also be enabled with the help of the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
trace() 
</pre>
<p>The above function returns the current trace level.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>None</p>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say trace() 

/* Main program */ 
n = 100.45 if datatype( n, wholenumber ) then signal msg 

say 'This is a whole number' 
return 0 
msg : 

say 'This is an incorrect number ' 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
N 
This is an incorrect number 
</pre>
<p>The first line of N denotes that the trace is set to Normal.</p>
<h2>Setting Trace Value</h2>
<p>The trace level can be set with the trace function. The general syntax and example are shown below.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
trace(travel_level) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>trace_level</b> &minus; This is similar to the options available for setting the trace level.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>The above function gives the current trace level.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
say trace() 
current_trace = trace('A') 
say current_trace 

/* Main program */ 
n = 100.45 if datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
signal msg say 'This is a whole number' 
return 0 
msg : 
say ' This is an incorrect number ' 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as follows &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
N 
   4 *-* say current_trace 
N 
   6 *-* n = 100.45 
   7 *-* if \ datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
   8 *-* signal msg 
   12 *-* say 'This is an incorrect number' 
'This is an incorrect number' 
</pre>
<h2>Interactive Tracing</h2>
<p>Interactive tracing is wherein, tracing is carried out as the program runs. Just like in an IDE such as Visual Studio for .Net, in which you can add breakpoints and see how each statement executes, similarly here also you can see the program as each code line runs.</p>
<p>The general syntax is as follows &minus;</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
trace ?options 
</pre>
<p>Where, options are the same for the trace command as shown below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>A</b> &minus; Traces all the commands</p></li>
<li><p><b>C</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>E</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in an error.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>F</b> &minus; Only traces the host commands which are sent to the operating system which have resulted in a failure.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>I</b> &minus; This provides an intermediate level tracing of Rexx commands.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>L</b> &minus; This option is if you want to label the tracing as it happens.</p></li> 
<li><p><b>N</b> &minus; This is the default option in which no tracing happens.</p></li> 
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of implementing active tracing.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
trace ?A

/* Main program */ 
n = 100.45 if datatype( n, wholenumber ) then 
signal msg 

say 'This is a whole number' 
return 0 
msg : say 'This is an incorrect number' 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown in the following program. The trace will stop at each line of code; then you need to press the Enter button to move onto the next line of code.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
   4 *-* n=100.45 
      +++ Interactive trace. "Trace Off" to end debug. ENTER to continue.  
   5 *-* if \ datatype( n, wholenumber ) then  
   6 *-* signal msg 
   10 *-* say 'Incorrect number , should be a whole number' 
Incorrect number , should be a whole number
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Error Handling</h1>
<p>Rexx has the ability to also work on Error handling as in other programming languages.</p>
<p>The following are some of the various error conditions that are seen in Rexx.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>ERROR</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in an error.</p></li>
<li><p><b>FAILURE</b> &minus; This even is raised whenever a command which is sent to the operating system results in a failure.</p></li>
<li><p><b>HALT</b> &minus; This is normally raised whenever an operation is dependent on another operation. An example is if an I/O operation is being halted for any reason.</p></li>
<li><p><b>NOVALUE</b> &minus; This event is raised when a value has not been assigned to a variable.</p></li>
<li><p><b>NOTREADY</b> &minus; This is raised by any I/O device which is not ready to accept any operation.</p></li>
<li><p><b>SYNTAX</b> &minus; This event is raised if there is any syntax error in the code.</p></li>
<li><p><b>LOSTDIGITS</b> &minus; This event is raised when an arithmetic operation results in a loss of digits during the operation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Trapping Errors</h2>
<p>Errors are trapped with the help of the signal command. Let’s take a look at the syntax and an example of this.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
signal on [Errorcondition]
</pre>
<p>Where,</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Errorcondition</b> &minus; This is the error condition which is given above.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example on this.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
signal on error 
signal on failure 
signal on syntax 
signal on novalue beep(1) 
signal off error 
signal off failure
signal off syntax 
signal off novalue 
exit 0 
error: failure: syntax: novalue: 
say 'An error has occured'
</pre>
<p>In the above example, we first turn the error signals on. We then add a statement which will result in an error. We then have the error trap label to display a custom error message.</p>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
An error has occurred.
</pre>
<p>An example of error codes is shown in the following program.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
signal on error 
signal on failure 
signal on syntax 
signal on novalue beep(1) 
exit 0 
error: failure: syntax: novalue: 

say 'An error has occured' 
say rc 
say sigl 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
An error has occured

<h1>Rexx - Object Oriented</h1>
<p>When you install ooRexx as per the environment chapter, you will also have the ability to work with classes and objects. Please note that all of the following code needs to be run in the ooRexx interpreter. The normal Rexx interpreter will not be able to run this object oriented code.</p>
<h2>Class and Method Declarations</h2>
<p>A class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
::class classname 
</pre>
<p>where <b>classname</b> is the name given to the class.</p>
<p>A method in a class is defined with the following Syntax declaration.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
::method methodname 
</pre>
<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the name given to the method.</p>
<p>A property in a class is defined with the below Syntax declaration.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
::attribute propertyname 
</pre>
<p>Where <b>propertyname</b> is the name given to the property.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following is an example of a class in Rexx.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
::class student 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
</pre>
<p>The following points need to be noted about the above program.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The name of the class is student.</li>
<li>The class has 2 properties, StudentID and StudentName.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getter and Setter Methods</h2>
<p>The Getter and Setter methods are used to automatically set and get the values of the properties. In Rexx, when you declare a property with the attribute keyword, the getter and setter methods are already put in place.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
::class student 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
</pre>
<p>In the above example, there would be Getter and Setter methods for StudentId and StudentName.</p>
<p>An example of how they can be used is shown in the following program.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
value = .student~new 
value~StudentID = 1 
value~StudentName = 'Joe' 
say value~StudentID 
say value~StudentName 

exit 0 
::class student 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
1 
Joe 
</pre>
<h2>Instance Methods</h2>
<p>Objects can be created from the class via the <b>~new operator</b>. A method from the class can be called in the following way.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Object~methodname 
</pre>
<p>Where <b>methodname</b> is the method which needs to be invoked from the class.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how an object can be created from a class and the respective method invoked.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
value = .student~new 
value~StudentID = 1 
value~StudentName = 'Joe' 
value~Marks1 = 10 
value~Marks2 = 20 
value~Marks3 = 30 
total = value~Total(value~Marks1,value~Marks2,value~Marks3) 
say total 

exit 0 
::class student 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
::attribute Marks1 
::attribute Marks2 
::attribute Marks3 
::method 'Total' 
use arg a,b,c 
return (ABS(a) + ABS(b) + ABS(c)) 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
60 
</pre>
<h2>Creating Multiple Objects</h2>
<p>One can also create multiple objects of a class. The following example will show how this can be achieved.</p>
<p>In here we are creating 3 objects (st, st1 and st2) and calling their instance members and instance methods accordingly.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example of how multiple objects can be created.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
st = .student~new 
st~StudentID = 1 
st~StudentName = 'Joe' 
st~Marks1 = 10 
st~Marks2 = 20 
st~Marks3 = 30 
total = st~Total(st~Marks1,st~Marks2,st~Marks3) 
say total  

st1  =  .student~new 
st1~StudentID = 2 
st1~StudentName = 'John' 
st1~Marks1 = 10 
st1~Marks2 = 20 
st1~Marks3 = 40 
total = st1~Total(st1~Marks1,st1~Marks2,st1~Marks3) 
say total  

st2  =  .student~new 
st2~StudentID = 3 
st2~StudentName = 'Mark' 
st2~Marks1 = 10 
st2~Marks2 = 20 
st2~Marks3 = 30 
total = st2~Total(st2~Marks1,st2~Marks2,st2~Marks3) 
say total  

exit 0 
::class student 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
::attribute Marks1 
::attribute Marks2 
::attribute Marks3 
::method 'Total' 
use arg a,b,c 
return (ABS(a) + ABS(b) + ABS(c)) 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
60 
70 
80 
</pre>
<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. With the use of inheritance, the information is made manageable in a hierarchical order.</p>
<p>The class which inherits the properties of other is known as <b>subclass</b> (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as <b>superclass</b> (base class, parent class).</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of inheritance in Rexx. In the following example we are creating a class called <b>Person</b>. From there we use the subclass keyword to create the <b>Student class</b> as a <b>sub-class of Person</b>.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
st = .student~new 
st~StudentID = 1 
st~StudentName = 'Joe' 
st~Marks1 = 10 
st~Marks2 = 20 
st~Marks3 = 30 
say st~Total(st~Marks1,st~Marks2,st~Marks3)  

exit 0 
::class Person 
::class student subclass Person 
::attribute StudentID 
::attribute StudentName 
::attribute Marks1 
::attribute Marks2 
::attribute Marks3 
::method 'Total' 
use arg a,b,c 
return (ABS(a) + ABS(b) + ABS(c)) 
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program will be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>Rexx - Portability</h1>
<p>Portability is an important aspect in any programming language. As one knows, Rexx is available in a variety of operating systems such as Windows and Linux. So it need to be ensured that when one develops a program on the Windows platform, that it has the necessary precautions taken if the same programs runs on a Linux platform.</p>
<p>Rexx has the ability to run system level commands. There are commands which can be used to understand what is the operating system on which it is running on. Based on the output it can then take the appropriate actions to see what are the commands that can be run on this operating system.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following example shows how the parse functions are used to get the details of the operating system on which the program is running.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
parse version language level date month year. 
parse source system invocation filename. 
language = translate(language) 

if pos('REGINA',language) = 0 then 
   say 'Error , the default interpreter is not Regina' language 
   say 'The Interpreter version/release date is:' date month year 
   say 'The Language level is: ' level say 'The Operating System is'  

   select 
when system = 'WIN32' then 
   'ver'
when system = 'UNIX' | system = 'LINUX' then 
   'uname -a' 
   otherwise 
   say 'Unknown System:' system 
end 
if rc &lt;&gt; 0 then 
   say 'Error :' rc 
</pre>
<p>The output will vary depending on operating system. A sample output is given below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
The Interpreter version/release date: 5 Apr 2015 
The Language level is:  5.00 
The Operating System is 
Unknown System: WIN64 
Bad return code: RC

<h1>Rexx - Implementations</h1>
<p>The Rexx language has a lot of various implementations as we have already seen in the previous chapters. Each implementation has its own functionality. Let’s look at the various implementations available for Rexx.</p>
<h2>OoRexx</h2>
<p>This is the object oriented version of Rexx. By default, the Rexx basic implementation is all based on procedures. But with ooRexx you can offer greater flexibility by having an Object oriented approach to Rexx. By using ooRexx you can have better re-use through creating re-usable classes and objects.</p>
<p>The following program is an example of a simple Rexx program which can be run with the ooRexx implementer.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say ‘hello’ 
</pre>
<p>To run this program, run the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
rexx main.rexx 
</pre>
<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
hello
</pre>
<h2>Netrexx</h2>
<p>This is for all Java based developers as it provides a Java based alternative for the Rexx language. So all of the objects are based on the Java Object Model. The advantage of this framework is that since Java is a widely popular language it becomes easier for developers to use this framework. So in this implementation, the Rexx code is converted to a Java program which can then be run on any Java virtual machine.</p>
<p>The following code is an example of a NetRexx program.</p>
<p>Create a file called <b>main.nrx</b> and place the following code in the file.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say ‘hello’
</pre>
<p>To compile the code run the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
NetRexxC main.nrx 
</pre>
<p>You will then get the following output. NetRexxC is the compiler which converts the Rexx program to its java equivalent.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
java -cp ";;G:\NetRexx-3.04GA\lib\NetRexxF.jar;."

<p>You can now run your java program using the following java command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
java main 
</pre>
<p>When you run the above command, you will get the following output.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Hello
</pre>
<h2>Brexx</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight implementation of Rexx. This is a lighter package than the standard Rexx implementer. But it still has the full functionality of Rexx.</p>
<p>The following code is an example of a BRexx program.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say ‘hello’
</pre>
<p>To run the program, run the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<h1>Rexx - Netrexx</h1>
<p>NetRexx is the java implementation of Rexx. In NetRexx, the implementer is used to convert the Rexx program to a java program which can then be run on any Java virtual machine.</p>
<h2>Setting up NetRexx</h2>
<p>The first step in NetRexx is to set it up on the local machine. To do this, one needs to perform the following steps &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to the NetRexx download site &minus; <a href="http://www.netrexx.org/downloads.nsp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.netrexx.org/downloads.nsp</a></p>
<img src="/rexx/images/netrexx.jpg" alt="Netrexx" />
<p>Download the NetRexx.3.04.GA file.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Ensure that java is installed and running on your system. You can verify that java is running by using the java–version command.</p>
<p>An example of the output is shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
H:\&gt;java -version 
java version "1.7.0_79" 
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_79-b15) 
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 24.79-b02, mixed mode, sharing) 
</pre>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Unzip the contents of the Netrexx zipped file. Copy the files from the NetRexx3.04GA\lib folder to your java installation/lib/etc folder.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add the NetRexx-3.04GA\bin path to the path variable on the system.</p>
<h2>Running the First NetRexx Program</h2>

<h1>Rexx - Databases</h1>
<p>Rexx has the ability to work with a variety of databases which are listed below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>HSQLDB</li>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>SQL Server</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
</ul>
<p>All the information for Rexx databases can be found once you click on the following link &minus; <a href="http://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://rexxsql.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<img src="/rexx/images/databases.jpg" alt="Databases" />
<p>In our example, we are going to use MySQL DB as a sample. So the first step is to ensure to download the required drivers from the Rexx SQL site so that Rexx programs can work with SQL accordingly. So follow the subsequent steps to ensure that Rexx programs can work with MySQL databases.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Go to the following drivers download page from the Rexx site &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxsql/files/rexxsql/2.6/</a></p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Download the MYSQL drivers - rxsql26B3_my_w32_ooRexx</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Unzip the contents to the local machine.</p>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Add the path of the unzipped folder to the path variable on your machine.</p>
<p>For all the subsequent examples, make sure of the following pointers are in place &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>You have created a database TESTDB.</p></li> 
<li><p>You have created a table EMPLOYEE in TESTDB.</p></li> 
<li><p>This table has fields FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, AGE, SEX and INCOME.</p></li> 
<li><p>User ID "testuser" and password "test123" are set to access TESTDB.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure you have downloaded the mysql jar file and added the file to your classpath.</p></li> 
<li><p>You have gone through MySQL tutorial</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Database Connection</h2>
<p>To establish a database connection, you first need to the Rexxsql DLL and then use the SQLConnect function to establish a connection to the database. The syntax and example of how this can be achieved is given below.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SQLConnect(cname,username,password,dbname) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>cname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the connection.</p></li>
<li><p><b>username</b> &minus; The user name to connect to the database</p></li>
<li><p><b>password</b> &minus; The password to connect to the database</p></li>
<li><p><b>dbname</b> &minus; The database schema to connect to.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the database connection is successful.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
Call RxFuncAdd 'SQLLoadFuncs', 'rexxsql', 'SQLLoadFuncs' 
Call SQLLoadFuncs 
say SQLConnect(c1,' testuser ',' test123','testdb')
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
0
</pre>
<h2>Creating a Database Table</h2>
<p>The next step after connecting to the database is to create the tables in our database. The following example shows how to create a table in the database using Rexx. All of the commands in Rexx SQL are executed by using the SQLCommand function.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SQLConnect(sname,statement)
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>sname</b> &minus; This is the name to give to the statement to execute.</p></li>
<li><p><b>statement</b> &minus; This is the statement which needs to be executed against the database.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>A value equal to 0 will mean that the command was successful.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
Call RxFuncAdd 'SQLLoadFuncs', 'rexxsql', 'SQLLoadFuncs' 
Call SQLLoadFuncs 

if SQLConnect(c1,'testuser','test123','testdb') == 0 then say 'Connect Succedded' 
if SQLCommand(u1,"use testdb") == 0 then say 'Changed database to testdb' 
sqlstr = 'create table employee (first_name char(20) not null, last_name 
   char(20),age int, sex   
   char(1), income float)' 

if SQLCommand(c2,sqlstr) == 0 then say 'Employee table created'
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connect Succedded 
Changed database to testdb 
Employee table created 
</pre>
<h2>Operations on a Database Table</h2>
<p>The following types of operations are most commonly performed on a database table.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Operation &amp; Description</th>

<h2>Performing Transaction</h2>
<p>Transactions are a mechanism that ensures data consistency. Transactions have the following four properties &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>Atomicity</b> &minus; Either a transaction completes or nothing happens at all.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Consistency</b> &minus; A transaction must start in a consistent state and leave the system in a consistent state.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Isolation</b> &minus; Intermediate results of a transaction are not visible outside the current transaction.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Durability</b> &minus; Once a transaction was committed, the effects are persistent, even after a system failure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple example of how to implement transactions.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
Call RxFuncAdd 'SQLLoadFuncs', 'rexxsql', 'SQLLoadFuncs' 
Call SQLLoadFuncs 

if SQLConnect(c1,'testuser','test123','testdb') == 0 then say 'Connect Succedded' 
if SQLCommand(u1,"use testdb") == 0 then say 'Changed database to testdb' 
   sqlstr = "DELETE FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE AGE &gt; 20" 

if SQLCommand(c2,sqlstr) == 0 then 
if sqlcommit() == 0 then say committed
</pre>
<p>The output of the above program would be as shown below.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connect Succedded 
Changed database to testdb 
COMMITTED
</pre>
<h2>Commit Operation</h2>
<p>The commit operation is what tells the database to proceed ahead with the operation and finalize all changes to the database. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sqlcommit() 
</pre>
<h2>Rollback Operation</h2>
<p>If you are not satisfied with one or more of the changes and you want to revert back those changes completely, then use rollback method. In our above example, this is achieved by the following command.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
SqlRollback() 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Handheld &amp; Embedded Programming</h1>
<p>Handheld devices have come a long way and Rexx has a lot of ways in which it can run on these devices. Rexx has support for Pocket PC’s, Palm devices, PDA’s and other smart phone devices. The advantage of Rexx to work on these platforms is that Rexx is really a small weight programming system which just runs in the span of a few kilobytes. Hence it becomes easier to run Rexx programs on these devices.</p>
<p>Rexx on handheld devices can run in the following modes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The first mode is the native node where it runs directly on the operating system itself. The advantage on running in this mode is that it is faster since it runs directly off the operating system.</p></li>
<li><p>The next mode is on top of the DOS or emulator program on top of the hand held device. The advantage of this mode is that is can run on any type of operating system as long as the emulator runs on that operating system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Rexx Interpreters for the various hand held devices categories are shown below.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Windows CE – Brexx</li>
<li>Palm OS – Rexx for Palm OS</li>
<li>Symbian OS - Regina</li>
</ul>
<p>For the DOS emulator, the following steps need to be carried out &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; First is to download PocketDOS which is a popular DOS emulator. It is designed to run on many operating systems and has support for common VGA screens and serial and parallel ports.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to download the BRexx files for 16-bit DOS to a Windows PC.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; The final step is to use ActiveSync to sync the Rexx program to the handheld device.</p>
<p>There are some other commercial DOS based products available. XTM is a product which falls under this category. The features of this product are as follows &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Support for the 80186 CPU and instruction set.</p></li>
<li><p>It kind of works off the BIOS code for better performance.</p></li>
<li><p>It can provide emulation for the Math co-processor, version 8087 MPU</p></li>
<li><p>It provides access to the serial ports.</p></li>
<li><p>It supports a variety of languages such as English, French and German.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Rexx - Performance</h1>
<p>One of the key aspects of any programming language is the performance of the application. Special practices need to be taken care of to ensure that the application’s performance is not hampered. Let’s look at some of the considerations described in steps for better understanding &minus;</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Try to reduce the number of instructions – In Rexx each instruction carries an overhead. So try to reduce the number of instructions in your program. An example of instructions that can be redesigned is shown below.</p>
<p>Instead of using multiple if else statements one can use the parse statement. So like in the following program, instead of having an if condition for each value, and getting the value of word1, word2, word3 and word4, use the parse statement.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */  

parse value 'This is a Tutorial' with word1 word2 word3 word4 
say "'"word1"'" 
say "'"word2"'" 
say "'"word3"'" 
say "'"word4"'" 
</pre>
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; Try to combine multiple statements into one statement. An example is shown below.</p>
<p>Suppose if you had the following code which did the assignment for – <b>a and b</b> and passed it to a method called <b>proc</b>.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do i = 1 to 100 
a = 0 
b = 1 
call proc a,b 
end
</pre>
<p>You can easily replace the above given code with the following code using the parse statement.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
do i = 1 for 100 
parse value 0 1 with 
a, 
b, 
call proc a,b 
end 
</pre>
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Try to replace the <b>do..to loop</b> with the <b>do..for loop</b> wherever possible. This is normally recommended when the control variable is being iterated through a loop.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do i = 1 to 10 
say i 
end 
</pre>
<p>The above program should be replaced by the following program.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do i = 1 for 10 
say i 
end
</pre>
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; If possible, remove the for condition from a do loop as shown in the following program. If the control variable is not required, then just put the end value in the do loop as shown below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
do 10 
say hello 
end
</pre>
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; In a <b>select clause</b>, whatever u feel is the best condition which will be evaluated needs to put first in the <b>when clause</b>. So in the following example, if we know that 1 is the most frequent option, we put the <b>when 1 clause</b> as the first clause in the select statement.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
select 
when 1 then say'1' 
when 2 then say'2' 
otherwise say '3' 
end 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Best Programming Practices</h1>
<p>Every programmer wants their program to be the best when it comes to quality and efficiency. The following are some of the best programing practices or hints when writing Rexx programs which can help one achieve these goals.</p>
<h2>Hint 1</h2>
<p>Use the address command before you issue any command to the operating system or command prompt. This will help you get the address space beforehand in memory and cause your program to run more efficiently.</p>
<p>An example of the address command is shown below.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate tryit">
/* Main program */ 
address system dir 
</pre>
<p>The output of the command is as follows, but it could vary from system to system.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Volume in drive H is Apps 
Volume Serial Number is 8E66-AC3D  
Directory of H:\  
06/30/2016  01:28 AM    &lt;DIR&gt;          Apps 
07/05/2016  03:40 AM               463 main.class 
07/07/2016  01:30 AM                46 main.nrx 
07/07/2016  01:42 AM                38 main.rexx 
3 File(s)            547 bytes 
Dir(s)  313,085,173,760 bytes free
</pre>
<h2>Hint 2</h2>
<p>Ensure all commands to the operating system are in upper case and in quotes wherever possible.</p>
<p>An example for the same is shown below.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
options arexx_bifs 
say chdir('\REXXML100') 
say directory()
</pre>
<p>When we run the above program, we will get the following result.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
0 
D:\rexxxml100 
</pre>
<h2>Hint 3</h2>
<p>Avoid creating big comment blocks as shown in the following program.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/******/ 
/* */ 
/* */ 
/* */ 
/******/ 
/* Main program */ 
address system dir
</pre>
<h2>Hint 4</h2>
<p>Use the Parse statement to assign default values. An example for the same is shown below.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
parse value 0 1 with 
a, 
b 
</pre>
<h2>Hint 5</h2>
<p>Use the "Left(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,1,2)" statement.</p>
<h2>Hint 6</h2>
<p>Use the "Right(var1,2)" statement wherever possible instead of the “substr(var1,length(var1),2)" statement.</p>
<h1>Rexx - Graphical User Interface</h1>
<p>In order to use the graphic user interfaces available in Rexx, one needs to use 2 packages, one is called <b>ActiveTcl</b> and the other is the <b>Rexxtk</b> package. Along with these 2 packages, one can design normal forms which can have buttons and other controls on the forms.</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is the environment setup. Let’s go through the following steps to have the environment in place.</p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> &minus; Download the Activetcl package from the following website &minus; <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.activestate.com/activetcl</a></p>
<img src="/rexx/images/active_state.jpg" alt="Active State" />
<p><b>Step 2</b> &minus; The next step is to start the installation of ActiveTCl. Click on the Next button on the screen to proceed.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/installation_of_active_tci.jpg" alt="Installation of Active TCI" />
<p><b>Step 3</b> &minus; Accept the license Agreement and click on the Next button.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/accept_license_agreement.jpg" alt="Accept License Agreement" />
<p><b>Step 4</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation and click on the next button.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/location_for_installation.jpg" alt="Location for Installation" />
<p><b>Step 5</b> &minus; Choose a location for the installation of the demo’s and click on the Next button.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/demos.jpg" alt="Demo's" />
<p><b>Step 6</b> &minus; Click on the Next button to proceed with the installation.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/click_next.jpg" alt="Click Next" />
<p><b>Step 7</b> &minus; Click on the Finish button to complete the installation.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/click_finish.jpg" alt="Click Finish" />
<p><b>Step 8</b> &minus; The next step is to download the Rexxtk software from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/rexxtk/</a></p>
<p><b>Step 9</b> &minus; Double click the installer file from the link in the previous step to start the installation. Click on the next button to proceed.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/installer_file.jpg" alt="Installer File" />
<p><b>Step 10</b> &minus; In the next screen, click on the Yes button to agree to the License Agreement.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/click_yes.jpg" alt="Click Yes" />
<p><b>Step 11</b> &minus; In the next screen, choose the location for the installation and click on the Next button.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/choose_location.jpg" alt="Choose Location" />
<p><b>Step 12</b> &minus; Choose the Program folder location and click on the next button.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/program_folder_location.jpg" alt="Program Folder Location" />
<p>Once the installation is complete, we can now start with programming the GUI’s in Rexx.</p>
<h2>Basic Program</h2>
<p>Let’s see how we can design a simple basic program with Rexx in a graphical user interface format.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
call RxFuncAdd 'TkLoadFuncs','rexxtk','TkLoadFuncs' 
call TkLoadFuncs 
do forever 
interpret 'Call' TkWait() 
end 
call TkDropFuncs 
exit 0 
</pre>
<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The Rexxtk library and all of its functions are loaded using the RxFuncAdd command.</p></li>
<li><p>The do forever loop will keep the window open and will wait for the user input.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the user input is detected, the program will exit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/output.jpg" alt="Output" />
<h2>Creating Menus</h2>
<p>Menus are created with the help of the TkMenu and TkAdd functions. The syntax of these functions are given below.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
TkMenu(widgetname,options,0) 
</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><b>Widgetname</b> &minus; A name to give to the menu.</p>
<p>Options can be anyone of the following &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>selectcolor</b> &minus; if checkboxes or radio buttons are used as menu options, then this option specifies the color to choose when any menu option is selected.</p></li>
<li><p><b>tearoff</b> &minus; This option is used for adding sub menus to the main menu.</p></li>
<li><p><b>title</b> &minus; The string that needs to be used to give the window a title.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>A handle to the menu created.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
call RxFuncAdd 'TkLoadFuncs','rexxtk','TkLoadFuncs' 
call TkLoadFuncs 

menubar = TkMenu('.m1') 
filemenu = TkMenu('.m1.file','-tearoff', 0) 
call TkAdd menubar, 'cascade', '-label', 'File', '-menu', filemenu 
call TkAdd filemenu, 'command', '-label', 'Open...', '-rexx', 'getfile' 
call TkConfig '.', '-menu', menubar 

do forever 
interpret 'Call' TkWait() 
end 
call TkDropFuncs 
exit 0
</pre>
<p>The following things need to be noted about the above program &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>The menubar is created using the TkMenu function. The ‘tearoff’ parameter means that we need to create submenus which is going to be attached to the main menu.</p></li>
<li><p>We then add 2 menu options called File and Open using the TkAdd function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When the above program is executed, you will get the following output.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/output_file.jpg" alt="Output File" />
<h1>Rexx - Reginald</h1>
<p>Reginald is another Rexx interpreter which was developed by Jeff Glantt and has some customizations on how Rexx programs can be run. In this section, we will see how to get Reginald setup and run a few Rexx programs in it.</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>The first step is the environment setup which is to download the Reginald files. This can be done from the following website link &minus; <a href="http://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.manmrk.net/tutorials/rexx/Reginald/win32/rxusrw32.htm</a></p>
<img src="/rexx/images/reginald.jpg" alt="Reginald" />
<p>Once the download is complete and you launch the installer, the next screen will allow you to choose the install location.</p>
<p>Click the Install button to proceed.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/install_reginald.jpg" alt="Install Reginald" />
<p>Once complete, we can now start to run one sample program in the Reginald interpreter. Create a simple program as shown below.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say 'Hello' 
</pre>
<p>Then run the following command &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
RxLaunch.exe main.rexx 
</pre>
<p>You will then get the following output. This program will now be running in the Reginald interpreter.</p>
<img src="/rexx/images/reginald_interpreter.jpg" alt="Reginald Interpreter" />
<h2>Other Functions Available</h2>
<p>Apart from the normal Rexx commands, Reginald had some specific commands that are tailor-made for the Windows operating system. DriveMap is one such command &minus;</p>
<h3>DriveMap</h3>
<p>This function gives information on the drive.</p>
<p><b>Syntax</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Drivemap(,options) 
</pre>
<p><b>Parameters</b> &minus;</p>
<p><b>Options</b> &minus; These are a list of keywords which can be used to get various information on the drives of the local computer.</p>
<p><b>Return Value</b></p>
<p>A string value which has information on the drive.</p>
<p><b>Example</b> &minus;</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
/* Main program */ 
say 'Drives on system : ' DriveMap(,'FIXED') 
</pre>
<p>If the above program is run, you will get the following output. This output depends from system to system.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
List of disk drives :  C:\ D:\ 
</pre>
<h1>Rexx - Web Programming</h1>
<p>Rexx has the facility to work with web servers as well. The most common being the apache web server. In order to use Rexxw with the Apache web server, you need to first download the Rexx modules from the following link &minus; <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://sourceforge.net/projects/modrexx/?source=typ_redirect</a></p>
<p>Once done, make sure to add the mod Rexx modules to the class path.</p>
<p>The following lines need to be added and modified to the Apache configuration file.</p>
<p>The following lines need to be added to the end of the appropriate &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>httpd.conf LoadModule list.</li> 
<li>LoadModule rexx_module modules/mod_rexx.dll</li> 
</ul>
<p>The following lines should be added at the end of the <b>http.conf</b> file.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>AddType application/x-httpd-rexx-script .rex .rexx</li> 
<li>AddType application/x-httpd-rexx-rsp .rsp</li> 
<li>Add these for REXX Server Page support</li> 
<li>RexxRspCompiler “c:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/bin/rspcomp.rex”</li> 
</ul>
<p>Once the above changes have been made, you need to shut down and restart your apache web server.</p>
<p>The above lines also allow you to have Rexx based server pages just like Java server pages. You can add the Rexx code directly to the html pages.</p>
