<h1>HTTP Tutorial</h1>

<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.</p>

<p>This tutorial is based on RFC-2616 specification, which defines the protocol referred to as HTTP/1.1. HTTP/1.1 is a revision of the original HTTP (HTTP/1.0). A major difference between HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 is that HTTP/1.0 uses a new connection for each request/response exchange, where as HTTP/1.1 connection may be used for one or more request/response exchanges.</p>

<h1>Audience</h1>

<p>This tutorial has been prepared for computer science graduates and web developers to help them understand the basic to advanced level concepts related to Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</p>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>Before proceeding with this tutorial, it is good to have a basic understanding of web concepts, web browsers, web servers, client and server architecture based software.</p>

<title>HTTP Overview</title>

<h1>HTTP - Overview</h1>

<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.</p>

<p>Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for  computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.</p>

<h2>Basic Features</h2>

<p>There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:</p>

<p><b>HTTP is connectionless:</b> The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request  and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. The server processes the request and re-establishes the connection with the client to send a response back.</p>

<p><b>HTTP is media independent:</b> It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.</p>

<p><b>HTTP is stateless:</b> As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.</p>

<h2>Basic Architecture</h2>

<p>The following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:</p>

<p>The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the  Web server acts as a server.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possible entity-body content.</p>

<title>HTTP Parameters</title>

<h1>HTTP - Parameters</h1>

<p>This chapter is going to list down few of the important HTTP Protocol Parameters and their syntax the way they are used in the communication. For example, format for date, format of URL, etc. This will help you in constructing your request and response messages while writing HTTP client or server programs. You will see the complete usage of these parameters in subsequent chapters while learning the message structure for HTTP requests and responses.</p>

<h2>HTTP Version</h2>

<p>HTTP uses a <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b> numbering scheme to indicate versions of the protocol. The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in the first line. Here is the general syntax of specifying HTTP version number:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers</h2>

<p>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) are simply formatted, case-insensitive string containing name, location, etc. to identify a resource, for example, a website, a web service, etc. A general syntax of URI used for HTTP is as follows:</p>

<p>Here if the <b>port</b> is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed for HTTP and an empty <b>abs_path</b> is equivalent to an <b>abs_path</b> of "/". The characters other than those in the <b>reserved</b> and <b>unsafe</b> sets are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>The following three URIs are equivalent:</p>

<h2>Date/Time Formats</h2>

<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>

<h2>Character Sets</h2>

<p>We use character sets to specify the character sets that the client prefers. Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas. If a value is not specified, the default is the US-ASCII.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following are the valid character sets:</p>

<h2>Content Encodings</h2>

<p>A content encoding value indicates that an encoding algorithm has been used to encode the content before passing it over the network.  Content coding are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity.</p>

<p>All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding  header fields which we will see in the subsequent chapters.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following are the valid encoding schemes:</p>

<h2>Media Types</h2>

<p>HTTP uses Internet Media Types in the <b>Content-Type</b> and <b>Accept</b> header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation. All the Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). The general syntax to specify media type is as follows:</p>

<p>The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case--insensitive.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Language Tags</h2>

<p>HTTP uses language tags within the <b>Accept-Language</b> and <b>Content-Language</b> fields. A language tag is composed of one or more parts: a primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:</p>

<p>White spaces are not allowed within the tag and all tags are case- insensitive.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Example tags include:</p>

<p>where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code.</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.0

or

HTTP/1.1
</pre>
<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers</h2>
<p>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) are simply formatted, case-insensitive string containing name, location, etc. to identify a resource, for example, a website, a web service, etc. A general syntax of URI used for HTTP is as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
URI = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
</pre>
<p>Here if the <b>port</b> is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed for HTTP and an empty <b>abs_path</b> is equivalent to an <b>abs_path</b> of "/". The characters other than those in the <b>reserved</b> and <b>unsafe</b> sets are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following three URIs are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html
http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html
http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html
</pre>
<h2>Date/Time Formats</h2>
<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</pre>
<h2>Character Sets</h2>
<p>We use character sets to specify the character sets that the client prefers. Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas. If a value is not specified, the default is the US-ASCII.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following are the valid character sets:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
US-ASCII

or

ISO-8859-1

or 

ISO-8859-7
</pre>
<h2>Content Encodings</h2>
<p>A content encoding value indicates that an encoding algorithm has been used to encode the content before passing it over the network.  Content coding are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity.</p>
<p>All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding  header fields which we will see in the subsequent chapters.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following are the valid encoding schemes:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-encoding: gzip

or

Accept-encoding: compress

or 

Accept-encoding: deflate
</pre>
<h2>Media Types</h2>
<p>HTTP uses Internet Media Types in the <b>Content-Type</b> and <b>Accept</b> header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation. All the Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority (IANA). The general syntax to specify media type is as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
media-type     = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )
</pre>
<p>The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case--insensitive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept: image/gif
</pre>
<h2>Language Tags</h2>
<p>HTTP uses language tags within the <b>Accept-Language</b> and <b>Content-Language</b> fields. A language tag is composed of one or more parts: a primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
language-tag  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
</pre>
<p>White spaces are not allowed within the tag and all tags are case- insensitive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Example tags include:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin
</pre>

<title>HTTP Messages</title>

<h1>HTTP - Messages</h1>

<p>HTTP is  based on the client-server architecture model and a stateless request/response protocol that operates by exchanging messages across a reliable TCP/IP connection.</p>

<p>An HTTP "client" is a program (Web browser or any other client) that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of sending one or more HTTP request messages.  An HTTP "server" is a program ( generally a web server like Apache Web Server or Internet Information Services IIS, etc. ) that accepts connections in order to serve HTTP requests by sending HTTP response messages.</p>

<p>HTTP requests and HTTP responses use a generic message format of RFC 822 for transferring the required data. This generic message format consists of the following four items.</p>

<p>In the following sections, we will explain each of the entities used in an HTTP message.</p>

<h2>Message Start-Line</h2>

<p>A start-line will have the following generic syntax:</p>

<p>We will discuss Request-Line and Status-Line while discussing HTTP Request and HTTP Response messages respectively. For now, let's see the examples of start line in case of request and response:</p>

<h2>Header Fields</h2>

<p>HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are four types of HTTP message headers:</p>

<p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p>

<p><b>Request-header:</b> These header fields have applicability only for request messages.</p>

<p><b>Response-header:</b> These header fields have applicability only for response messages.</p>

<p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define meta information about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.</p>

<p>All the above mentioned headers follow the same generic format and each  of the header field consists of a name followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and the field value as follows:</p>

<p>Following are the examples of various header fields:</p>

<h2>Message Body</h2>

<p>The message body part is optional for an HTTP message but if it is available, then it is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response. If entity body is associated, then usually <b>Content-Type</b> and <b>Content-Length</b> headers lines specify the nature of the body associated.</p>

<p>A message body is the one which carries the actual HTTP request data (including form data and uploaded, etc.) and HTTP response data from the server ( including files, images, etc.). Shown below is the simple content of a message body:</p>

<p>Next two chapters will make use of above explained concepts to prepare HTTP Requests and HTTP Responses.</p>

 HTTP-message   = &lt;Request&gt; | &lt;Response&gt; ; HTTP/1.1 messages
</pre>
<p>HTTP requests and HTTP responses use a generic message format of RFC 822 for transferring the required data. This generic message format consists of the following four items.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
<ul class="list">
<li>A Start-line</li>
<li>Zero or more header fields followed by CRLF</li>
<li>An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) 
indicating the end of the header fields</li>
<li>Optionally a message-body</li>
</ul>
</pre>
<p>In the following sections, we will explain each of the entities used in an HTTP message.</p>
<h2>Message Start-Line</h2>
<p>A start-line will have the following generic syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
start-line = Request-Line | Status-Line
</pre>
<p>We will discuss Request-Line and Status-Line while discussing HTTP Request and HTTP Response messages respectively. For now, let's see the examples of start line in case of request and response:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1     (This is Request-Line sent by the client)

HTTP/1.1 200 OK             (This is Status-Line sent by the server)
</pre>
<h2>Header Fields</h2>
<p>HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are four types of HTTP message headers:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request-header:</b> These header fields have applicability only for request messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Response-header:</b> These header fields have applicability only for response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define meta information about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the above mentioned headers follow the same generic format and each  of the header field consists of a name followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and the field value as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
</pre>
<p>Following are the examples of various header fields:</p>

<h2>Message Body</h2>
<p>The message body part is optional for an HTTP message but if it is available, then it is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response.

   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<title>HTTP Requests</title>

<h1>HTTP - Requests</h1>

<p>An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:</p>

<p>The following sections explain each of the entities used in an HTTP request message.</p>

<h2>Request-Line</h2>

<p>The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>

<p>Let's discuss each of the parts mentioned in the Request-Line.</p>

<h2>Request Method</h2>

<p>The request <b>method</b> indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given <b>Request-URI</b>. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase. The following table lists all the supported methods in HTTP/1.1.</p>

<p>The GET method is used to retrieve  information from the given server using a given URI.  Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</p>

<p>Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.</p>

<p>Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.</p>

<p>Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.</p>

<p>Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.</p>

<p>Describe the communication options for the target resource.</p>

<p>Performs a message loop back test along with the path to the target resource.</p>

<h2>Request-URI</h2>

<p>The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI:</p>

<p><b>OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1</b></p>

<p><b>GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p>

<p><b>GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p>

<p><b>Host: www.w3.org</b></p>

<p>Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root).</p>

<h2>Request Header Fields</h2>

<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now, let's check what Request header fields are.</p>

<p>The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers.Here is a list of some important Request-header fields that can be used based on the requirement:</p>

<p>Accept-Charset</p>

<p> Accept-Encoding</p>

<p> Accept-Language</p>

<p> Authorization</p>

<p> Expect</p>

<p> From</p>

<p> Host</p>

<p> If-Match</p>

<p> If-Modified-Since</p>

<p> If-None-Match</p>

<p> If-Range</p>

<p> If-Unmodified-Since</p>

<p> Max-Forwards</p>

<p> Proxy-Authorization</p>

<p> Range</p>

<p> Referer</p>

<p> TE</p>

<p> User-Agent</p>

<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Client and Web Server.</p>

<h2> Examples of Request Message</h2>

<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>

<p>Here we are not sending any request data to the server because we are fetching a plain HTML page from the server. Connection is a general-header, and the rest of the headers are request headers. The following example shows how to send form data to the server using request message body:</p>

<p>Here the given URL <i>/cgi-bin/process.cgi</i> will be used to process the passed data and accordingly, a response will be returned. Here <b>content-type</b> tells the server that the passed data is a simple web form data and <b>length</b> will be the actual length of the data put in the message body. The following example shows how you can pass plain XML to your web server:</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
<ul class="list">
<li>A Request-line</li>
<li>Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF</li>
<li>An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) 
indicating the end of the header fields</li>
<li>Optionally a message-body</li>
</pre>
<p>The following sections explain each of the entities used in an HTTP request message.</p>
<h2>Request-Line</h2>
<p>The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
</pre>
<p>Let's discuss each of the parts mentioned in the Request-Line.</p>
<h2>Request Method</h2>
<p>The request <b>method</b> indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given <b>Request-URI</b>. The method is case-sensitive and should always be mentioned in uppercase. The following table lists all the supported methods in HTTP/1.1.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Method and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><b>GET</b><p>The GET method is used to retrieve  information from the given server using a given URI.  Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><b>HEAD</b><p>Same as GET, but it transfers the status line and the header section only.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><b>POST</b><p>A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><b>PUT</b><p>Replaces all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><b>DELETE</b><p>Removes all the current representations of the target resource given by URI.</p></td>

<td><b>OPTIONS</b><p>Describe the communication options for the target resource.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td><b>TRACE</b><p>Performs a message loop back test along with the path to the target resource.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Request-URI</h2>
<p>The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
</pre><div style="clear:both";>&nbsp;</div>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Method and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>The asterisk <b>*</b> is used when an HTTP request does not apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. For example:
<p><b>OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1</b></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>The <b>absoluteURI</b> is used when an HTTP request is being made to a proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service from a valid cache, and return the response. For example:
<p><b>GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>The most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a resource on an origin server or gateway. For example, a client wishing to retrieve a resource directly from the origin server would create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.w3.org" and send the following lines:
<p><b>GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p>
<p><b>Host: www.w3.org</b></p>
<p>Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root).</p>

<h2> Examples of Request Message</h2>
<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">

<title>HTTP Responses</title>

<h1>HTTP - Responses</h1>

<p>After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:</p>

<p>The following sections explain each of the entities used in an HTTP response message.</p>

<h2>Message Status-Line</h2>

<p>A Status-Line consists of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>

<h2>HTTP Version</h2>

<p>A server supporting HTTP version 1.1 will return the following version information:</p>

<h2>Status Code</h2>

<p>The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:</p>

<p> It means the request was received and the process is continuing.</p>

<p> It means  the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</p>

<p> It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.</p>

<p> It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.</p>

<p> It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.</p>

<p>HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes. A list of all the status codes has been given in a separate chapter for your reference.</p>

<h2>Response Header Fields</h2>

<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now, let's check what Response header fields are.</p>

<p>The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.</p>

<p>Accept-Ranges</p>

<p>Age</p>

<p>ETag</p>

<p>Location</p>

<p>Proxy-Authenticate</p>

<p>Retry-After</p>

<p>Server</p>

<p>Vary</p>

<p>WWW-Authenticate</p>

<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Web Client and Server.</p>

<h2>Examples of Response Message</h2>

<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP response for a request to fetch the <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>

<p>The following example shows an HTTP response message displaying error condition when the web server could not find the requested page:</p>

<title>HTTP Methods</title>

<h1>HTTP - Methods</h1>

<p>The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below and this set can be expanded based on requirements. These method names are case sensitive and they must be used in uppercase.</p>

<p>The GET method is used to retrieve  information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</p>

<p>Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.</p>

<p>A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.</p>

<p>Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.</p>

<p>Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.</p>

<p>Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.</p>

<p>Describes the communication options for the target resource.</p>

<p>Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</p>

<h2>GET Method</h2>

<p>A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. The following example makes use of GET method to fetch hello.htm:</p>

<p>The server response against the above GET request will be as follows:</p>

<h2>HEAD Method</h2>

<p>The HEAD method is functionally similar to GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body. The following example makes use of HEAD method to fetch header information about hello.htm:</p>

<p>The server response against the above GET request will be as follows:</p>

<p>You can notice that here server the does not send any data after header.</p>

<h2>POST Method</h2>

<p>The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example, file update, form data, etc. The following example makes use of POST method to send  a form data to the server, which will be processed by a process.cgi and finally a response will be returned:</p>

<p>The server side script process.cgi processes the passed data and sends the following response:</p>

<h2>PUT Method</h2>

<p>The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to save the given entity-boy in <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>

<p>The server will store the given entity-body in <b>hello.htm</b> file and will send the following response back to the client:</p>

<h2>DELETE Method</h2>

<p>The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete a file at a location specified by the given URL. The following example requests the server to delete the given file <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>

<p>The server will delete the mentioned file <b>hello.htm</b> and will send the following response back to the client:</p>

<h2>CONNECT Method</h2>

<p>The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP. The following example requests a connection with a web server running on the host tutorialspoint.com:</p>

<p>The connection is established with the server and the following response is sent back to the client:</p>

<h2>OPTIONS Method</h2>

<p>The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify  a URL for the OPTIONS method,  or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. The following example requests a list of methods supported by a web server running on tutorialspoint.com:</p>

<p>The server will send an information based on the current configuration of the server, for example:</p>

<h2>TRACE Method</h2>

<p>The TRACE method is used to echo the contents of an HTTP Request back to the requester which can be used for debugging purpose at the time of development. The following example shows the usage of TRACE method:</p>

<p>The server will send the following message in response to the above request:</p>

<title>HTTP Status Codes</title>

<h1>HTTP - Status Codes</h1>

<p>The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:</p>

<p> It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.</p>

<p> It means  the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</p>

<p> It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.</p>

<p> It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.</p>

<p> It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.</p>

<p>HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all the registered status codes. Given below is a list of all the status codes.</p>

<h2>1xx: Information</h2>

<h2>2xx: Successful</h2>

<h2>3xx: Redirection</h2>

<h2>4xx: Client Error</h2>

<h2>5xx: Server Error</h2>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<title>HTTP Header Fields</title>

<h1>HTTP - Header Fields</h1>

<p>HTTP header fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are four types of HTTP message headers:</p>

<p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p>

<p><b>Client Request-header:</b> These header fields have  applicability only for request messages.</p>

<p><b>Server Response-header:</b> These header fields have  applicability only for response messages.</p>

<p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define meta information about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request.</p>

<h2>General Headers</h2>

<h3>Cache-Control</h3>

<p>The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all the caching system. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>An HTTP client or server can use the <b>Cache-control</b> general header to specify parameters for the cache or to request certain kinds of documents from the cache. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>

<p>The following table lists the important cache request directives that can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>

<p>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </p>

<p>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is not less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>Does not convert the entity-body.</p>

<p>Does not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.</p>

<p>The following important cache response directives that can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>

<p>Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.</p>

<p>Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache.</p>

<p>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful re-validation with the origin server.</p>

<p>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</p>

<p>Does not convert the entity-body.</p>

<p>The cache must verify the status of the stale documents before using it and expired ones should not be used.</p>

<p>The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.</p>

<h3>Connection</h3>

<p>The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections. Following is the simple syntax for using connection header:</p>

<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example:</p>

<p>By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the  connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default. If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the <b>keep-alive</b> parameter as follows:</p>

<h3>Date</h3>

<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>

<p>Here the first format is the most preferred one.</p>

<h3>Pragma</h3>

<p>The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. For example:</p>

<p>The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility. No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.</p>

<h3>Trailer</h3>

<p>The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding. Following is the syntax of Trailer header field:</p>

<p>Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:</p>

<p>Transfer-Encoding</p>

<p>Content-Length</p>

<p>Trailer</p>

<h3>Transfer-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Transfer-Encoding</i> general-header field indicates what type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body. The syntax of Transfer-Encoding header field is as follows:</p>

<p>All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.</p>

<h3>Upgrade</h3>

<p>The <i>Upgrade</i> general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. For example:</p>

<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.</p>

<h3>Via</h3>

<p>The <i>Via</i> general-header must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients.  For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu. The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:</p>

<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>The <i>Warning</i> general-header is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. A response may carry more than one Warning header.</p>

<h2>Client Request Headers</h2>

<h3>Accept</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept</i> request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. The general syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<p>This would be interpreted as <b>text/html</b> and <b>text/x-c</b> and are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the <b>text/x-dvi</b> entity, and if that does not exist, send the <b>text/plain</b> entity.</p>

<h3>Accept-Charset</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Charset</i> request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<p>The special value "*", if present in the <b>Accept-Charset</b> field, matches every character set and if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Accept-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Encoding</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Examples are as follows:</p>

<h3>Accept-Language</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Language</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for non preferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Authorization</h3>

<p>The <i>Authorization</i> request-header field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of <b>username:password</b> encoded in base 64. Following is an example:</p>

<p>The value decodes into is <b>guest:guest123</b> where <b>guest</b> is user ID and <b>guest123</b> is the password.</p>

<h3>Cookie</h3>

<p>The <i>Cookie</i> request-header  field value contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:</p>

<h3>Expect</h3>

<p>The <i>Expect</i> request-header field is used to indicate that a particular set of server behaviors is required by the client. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support, it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.</p>

<h3>From</h3>

<p>The <i>From</i> request-header field contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.</p>

<h3>Host</h3>

<p>The <i>Host</i> request-header field is used to specify the Internet host and the port number of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>A <b>host</b> without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80. For example, a request on the origin server for <i>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/</i> would be:</p>

<h3>If-Match</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists. Following are possible examples:</p>

<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-Modified-Since</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Modified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested URL has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body. The general syntax of if-modified-since is:</p>

<p>An example of the field is:</p>

<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-None-Match</h3>

<p>The <i>If-None-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if one of the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist. Following are the possible examples:</p>

<h3>If-Range</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Range</i> request-header field can be used with a conditional GET to request only the portion of the entity that is missing, if it has not been changed, and the entire entity if it has been changed. The general syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received.  For example:</p>

<p>Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header, otherwise it returns all of the new document.</p>

<h3>If-Unmodified-Since</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present. For example:</p>

<p>If the request results in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> header should be ignored.</p>

<h3>Max-Forwards</h3>

<p>The <i>Max-Forwards</i> request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. Here is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining number of times this request message may be forwarded. This is useful for debugging with the TRACE method, avoiding infinite loops.  For example:</p>

<p>The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in the HTTP specification.</p>

<h3>Proxy-Authorization</h3>

<p>The <i>Proxy-Authorization</i> request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. Here is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.</p>

<h3>Range</h3>

<p>The <i>Range</i> request-header field specifies the partial range(s) of the content requested from the document. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions specified are inclusive. You can specify a byte-unit as bytes. Byte offsets start at zero.  Some simple examples are as follows:</p>

<p>Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas. If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document. If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.</p>

<h3>Referer</h3>

<p>The <i>Referer</i> request-header field allows the client to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the URL has been requested. The general syntax is as follows:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the <i>Request-URI</i>.</p>

<h3>TE</h3>

<p>The <i>TE</i> request-header field indicates what extension <i>transfer-coding</i> it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked <i>transfer-coding</i>. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways:</p>

<p>If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, then only transfer-coding is <i>chunked</i>. A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.</p>

<h3>User-Agent</h3>

<p>The <i>User-Agent</i> request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<h2>Server Response Headers</h2>

<h3>Accept-Ranges</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Ranges</i> response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>For example a  server that accepts byte-range requests may send:</p>

<p> Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:</p>

<p>This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.</p>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>The <i>Age</i> response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache must include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache.</p>

<h3>ETag</h3>

<p>The <i>ETag</i> response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Here are some simple examples:</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The <i>Location</i> response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.</p>

<h3>Proxy-Authenticate</h3>

<p>The <i>Proxy-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included as a part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The general syntax is:</p>

<h3>Retry-After</h3>

<p>The <i>Retry-After</i> response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The <i>Server</i> response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.</p>

<h3>Set-Cookie</h3>

<p>The <i>Set-Cookie</i> response-header field contains a name/value pair of information to retain for this URL. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Here are the possible values you can specify as options:</p>

<p>This option can be used to specify any comment associated with the cookie.</p>

<p> The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.</p>

<p>The date the cookie will expire. If it is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p>

<p>The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs to which this cookie applies.</p>

<p>It instructs the user agent to return the cookie only under a secure connection.</p>

<p>Following is an example of a simple cookie header generated by the server:</p>

<h3>Vary</h3>

<p>The <i>Vary</i> response-header field specifies that the entity has multiple sources and may therefore vary according to the specified list of request header(s). Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>You can specify multiple headers separated by commas and a value of asterisk "*" signals that unspecified parameters are not limited to the request-headers. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>Here field names are case-insensitive.</p>

<h3>WWW-Authenticate</h3>

<p>The <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>WWW- Authenticate field value might contain more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters. Following is a simple example:</p>

<h2>Entity Headers</h2>

<h3>Allow</h3>

<p>The <i>Allow</i> entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>You can specify multiple methods separated by commas. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.</p>

<h3>Content-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Encoding</i> entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).</p>

<h3>Content-Language</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Language</i> entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.</p>

<h3>Content-Length</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Length</i> entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.</p>

<h3>Content-Location</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Location</i> entity-header field may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity. </p>

<h3>Content-MD5</h3>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.</p>

<h3>Content-Range</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Range</i> entity-header field  is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:</p>

<p>When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range,  this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,</p>

<h3>Content-Type</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Type</i> entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Expires</h3>

<p>The <i>Expires</i> entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Last-Modified</h3>

<p>The <i>Last-Modified</i> entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified. The general syntax is:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">
Cache-Control : cache-request-directive|cache-response-directive
</pre>
<p>An HTTP client or server can use the <b>Cache-control</b> general header to specify parameters for the cache or to request certain kinds of documents from the cache. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Cache-control: no-cache
</pre>
<p>The following table lists the important cache request directives that can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Cache Request Directive and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><b>no-cache</b><p>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><b>no-store</b><p>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><b>max-age = seconds</b><p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.</p></td>

<p>The following important cache response directives that can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Cache Response Directive and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><b>public</b><p>Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.</p></td>

</tr>
</table>
<h3>Connection</h3>
<p>The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections. Following is the simple syntax for using connection header:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connection : "Connection"
</pre>
<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the "close" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connection: close
</pre>
<p>By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the  connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default. If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the <b>keep-alive</b> parameter as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Connection: keep-alive
</pre>
<h3>Date</h3>
<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</pre>
<p>Here the first format is the most preferred one.</p>
<h3>Pragma</h3>
<p>The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Pragma: no-cache
</pre>
<p>The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility. No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.</p>
<h3>Trailer</h3>
<p>The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding. Following is the syntax of Trailer header field:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Trailer : field-name
</pre>
<p>Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Transfer-Encoding</p></li>
<li><p>Content-Length</p></li>
<li><p>Trailer</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Transfer-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Transfer-Encoding</i> general-header field indicates what type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body. The syntax of Transfer-Encoding header field is as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
</pre>
<p>All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.</p>
<h3>Upgrade</h3>
<p>The <i>Upgrade</i> general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
</pre>
<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.</p>
<h3>Via</h3>
<p>The <i>Via</i> general-header must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients.  For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu. The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)
</pre>
<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol.</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>The <i>Warning</i> general-header is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. A response may carry more than one Warning header.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Warning : warn-code SP warn-agent SP warn-text SP warn-date
</pre>
<h2>Client Request Headers</h2>
<h3>Accept</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept</i> request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. The general syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept: type/subtype [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
</pre>
<p>This would be interpreted as <b>text/html</b> and <b>text/x-c</b> and are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the <b>text/x-dvi</b> entity, and if that does not exist, send the <b>text/plain</b> entity.</p>
<h3>Accept-Charset</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Charset</i> request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Charset: character_set [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1; q=0.8
</pre>
<p>The special value "*", if present in the <b>Accept-Charset</b> field, matches every character set and if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.</p>
<h3>Accept-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Encoding</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Encoding: encoding types
</pre>
<p>Examples are as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
Accept-Encoding:
Accept-Encoding: *
Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
</pre>
<h3>Accept-Language</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Language</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Language: language [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for non preferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
</pre>
<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>The <i>Authorization</i> request-header field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Authorization : credentials
</pre>
<p>The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of <b>username:password</b> encoded in base 64. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Authorization: BASIC Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3QxMjM=
</pre>
<p>The value decodes into is <b>guest:guest123</b> where <b>guest</b> is user ID and <b>guest123</b> is the password.</p>
<h3>Cookie</h3>
<p>The <i>Cookie</i> request-header  field value contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Cookie: name=value
</pre>
<p>Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Cookie: name1=value1;name2=value2;name3=value3
</pre>
<h3>Expect</h3>
<p>The <i>Expect</i> request-header field is used to indicate that a particular set of server behaviors is required by the client. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Expect : 100-continue | expectation-extension
</pre>
<p>If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support, it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.</p>
<h3>From</h3>
<p>The <i>From</i> request-header field contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
From: webmaster@w3.org
</pre>
<p>This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.</p>
<h3>Host</h3>
<p>The <i>Host</i> request-header field is used to specify the Internet host and the port number of the resource being requested. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Host : "Host" ":" host [ ":" port ] ;
</pre>
<p>A <b>host</b> without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80. For example, a request on the origin server for <i>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/</i> would be:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.w3.org
</pre>
<h3>If-Match</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Match : entity-tag
</pre>
<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists. Following are possible examples:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Match: "xyzzy"
If-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-Match: *
</pre>
<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>
<h3>If-Modified-Since</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Modified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested URL has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body. The general syntax of if-modified-since is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Modified-Since : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>An example of the field is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>
<h3>If-None-Match</h3>
<p>The <i>If-None-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header requests the server to perform the requested method only if one of the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-None-Match : entity-tag
</pre>
<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist. Following are the possible examples:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-None-Match: "xyzzy"
If-None-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-None-Match: *
</pre>
<h3>If-Range</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Range</i> request-header field can be used with a conditional GET to request only the portion of the entity that is missing, if it has not been changed, and the entire entity if it has been changed. The general syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Range : entity-tag | HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received.  For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Range: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header, otherwise it returns all of the new document.</p>
<h3>If-Unmodified-Since</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Unmodified-Since : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present. For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>If the request results in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> header should be ignored.</p>
<h3>Max-Forwards</h3>
<p>The <i>Max-Forwards</i> request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. Here is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Max-Forwards : n
</pre>
<p>The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining number of times this request message may be forwarded. This is useful for debugging with the TRACE method, avoiding infinite loops.  For example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Max-Forwards : 5
</pre>
<p>The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in the HTTP specification.</p>
<h3>Proxy-Authorization</h3>
<p>The <i>Proxy-Authorization</i> request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. Here is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Proxy-Authorization : credentials
</pre>
<p>The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.</p>
<h3>Range</h3>
<p>The <i>Range</i> request-header field specifies the partial range(s) of the content requested from the document. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Range: bytes-unit=first-byte-pos "-" [last-byte-pos]
</pre>
<p>The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions specified are inclusive. You can specify a byte-unit as bytes. Byte offsets start at zero.  Some simple examples are as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
- The first 500 bytes 
Range: bytes=0-499

- The second 500 bytes
Range: bytes=500-999

- The final 500 bytes
Range: bytes=-500

- The first and last bytes only
Range: bytes=0-0,-1
</pre>
<p>Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas. If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document. If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.</p>
<h3>Referer</h3>
<p>The <i>Referer</i> request-header field allows the client to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the URL has been requested. The general syntax is as follows:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Referer : absoluteURI | relativeURI
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Referer: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the <i>Request-URI</i>.</p>
<h3>TE</h3>
<p>The <i>TE</i> request-header field indicates what extension <i>transfer-coding</i> it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked <i>transfer-coding</i>. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
TE   : t-codings
</pre>
<p>The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
TE: deflate
TE:
TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5
</pre>
<p>If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, then only transfer-coding is <i>chunked</i>. A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.</p>
<h3>User-Agent</h3>
<p>The <i>User-Agent</i> request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="replace notranslate">
User-Agent : product | comment
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
</pre>
<h2>Server Response Headers</h2>
<h3>Accept-Ranges</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Ranges</i> response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Ranges  : range-unit | none
</pre>
<p>For example a  server that accepts byte-range requests may send:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Ranges: bytes
</pre>
<p> Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Accept-Ranges: none
</pre>
<p>This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.</p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>The <i>Age</i> response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Age : delta-seconds
</pre>
<p>Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Age: 1030
</pre>
<p>An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache must include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache.</p>
<h3>ETag</h3>
<p>The <i>ETag</i> response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ETag :  entity-tag
</pre>
<p>Here are some simple examples:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
ETag: "xyzzy"
ETag: W/"xyzzy"
ETag: ""
</pre>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The <i>Location</i> response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Location : absoluteURI
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.</p>
<h3>Proxy-Authenticate</h3>
<p>The <i>Proxy-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included as a part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Proxy-Authenticate  : challenge
</pre>
<h3>Retry-After</h3>
<p>The <i>Retry-After</i> response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Retry-After : HTTP-date | delta-seconds
</pre>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Retry-After: 120
</pre>
<p>In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.</p>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>The <i>Server</i> response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Server : product | comment
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
</pre>
<p>If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.</p>
<h3>Set-Cookie</h3>
<p>The <i>Set-Cookie</i> response-header field contains a name/value pair of information to retain for this URL. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; OPTIONS
</pre>
<p>Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Here are the possible values you can specify as options:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr>
<th>S.N.</th>
<th>Options and Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td><b>Comment=comment</b><p>This option can be used to specify any comment associated with the cookie.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><b> Domain=domain</b><p> The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><b>Expires=Date-time</b><p>The date the cookie will expire. If it is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td><b> Path=path</b><p>The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs to which this cookie applies.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td><b>Secure</b><p>It instructs the user agent to return the cookie only under a secure connection.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Following is an example of a simple cookie header generated by the server:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
</pre>
<h3>Vary</h3>
<p>The <i>Vary</i> response-header field specifies that the entity has multiple sources and may therefore vary according to the specified list of request header(s). Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Vary : field-name
</pre>
<p>You can specify multiple headers separated by commas and a value of asterisk "*" signals that unspecified parameters are not limited to the request-headers. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
</pre>
<p>Here field names are case-insensitive.</p>
<h3>WWW-Authenticate</h3>
<p>The <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
WWW-Authenticate : challenge
</pre>
<p>WWW- Authenticate field value might contain more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Admin"
</pre>
<h2>Entity Headers</h2>
<h3>Allow</h3>
<p>The <i>Allow</i> entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Allow : Method
</pre>
<p>You can specify multiple methods separated by commas. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT
</pre>
<p>This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.</p>
<h3>Content-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Encoding</i> entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Encoding : content-coding
</pre>
<p>The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Encoding: gzip
</pre>
<p>If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).</p>
<h3>Content-Language</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Language</i> entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Language : language-tag
</pre>
<p>Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Language: mi, en
</pre>
<p>The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.</p>
<h3>Content-Length</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Length</i> entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Length : DIGITS
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Length: 3495
</pre>
<p>Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.</p>
<h3>Content-Location</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Location</i> entity-header field may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Location:  absoluteURI | relativeURI 
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity. </p>
<h3>Content-MD5</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-MD5</i> entity-header field may be used to supply an MD5 digest of the entity for checking the integrity
of the message upon receipt. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-MD5  : md5-digest using base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-MD5  : 8c2d46911f3f5a326455f0ed7a8ed3b3
</pre>
<p>The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.</p>
<h3>Content-Range</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Range</i> entity-header field  is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Range : bytes-unit SP first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos
</pre>
<p>Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
- The first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 0-499/1234

- The second 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-999/1234

- All except for the first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-1233/1234

- The last 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 734-1233/1234
</pre>
<p>When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range,  this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
Content-Length: 26012
Content-Type: image/gif
</pre>
<h3>Content-Type</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Type</i> entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent, had the request been a GET. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Type : media-type
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4
</pre>
<h3>Expires</h3>
<p>The <i>Expires</i> entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Expires : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT
</pre>
<h3>Last-Modified</h3>
<p>The <i>Last-Modified</i> entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Last-Modified: HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">
Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
</pre>

<title>HTTP Caching</title>

<h1>HTTP - Caching</h1>

<p>HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where performance can be improved by the use of response caches. The HTTP/1.1 protocol includes a number of elements intended to make caching work.</p>

<p>The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need to send requests in many cases, and to eliminate the need to send full responses in many other cases. </p>

<p>The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 are implicit directives to caches where server-specifies expiration times and validators. We use the <b>Cache-Control</b> header for this purpose.</p>

<p>The <b>Cache-Control</b> header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>

<p>The following cache request directives can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>

<p>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server.</p>

<p>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is not less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>Does not convert the entity-body.</p>

<p>Does not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.</p>

<p>The following cache response directives can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>

<p>Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.</p>

<p>Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache. </p>

<p>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful re-validation with the origin server.</p>

<p>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</p>

<p>Does not convert the entity-body.</p>

<p>The cache must verify the status of stale documents before using it and expired ones should not be used.</p>

<p>The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.</p>

<p>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is not greater than the specified time in seconds.</p>

<p>The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.</p>

<title>HTTP URL Encoding</title>

<h1>HTTP - URL Encoding</h1>

<p>HTTP URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII <i>character-set</i>, which often contain characters outside the ASCII set. So these unsafe characters must be replaced with a <b>%</b>  followed by two hexadecimal digits.</p>

<p>The following table shows the ASCII symbols of the characters and their replacements which can be used in the URL before passing it to the server:</p>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<title>HTTP Security</title>

<h1>HTTP - Security</h1>

<p>HTTP is used for communications over the internet, so application developers, information providers, and users should be aware of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1. This discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems mentioned here but it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.</p>

<h2>Personal Information Leakage</h2>

<p>HTTP clients are often privy to large amount of personal information  such as the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption keys, etc. So you should be very careful to prevent unintentional leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.</p>

<p>All the confidential information should be stored at the server in encrypted form.</p>

<p>Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is known to contain security holes.</p>

<p>Proxies that serve as a portal through a network firewall should take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information that identifies the hosts behind the firewall.</p>

<p>The information sent in the 'From' field might conflict with the user's privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence, it should not be transmitted without the user being able to disable, enable, and modify the contents of the field.</p>

<p>Clients should not include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request, if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol.</p>

<p>Authors of services that use the HTTP protocol should not use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because it will cause the data to be encoded in the Request-URI.</p>

<h2>File and Path Names Based Attack</h2>

<p>The document should be restricted to the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the server administrators.</p>

<p>For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use <b>'..'</b> as a path component to indicate a directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server MUST disallow any such construct in the Request-URI, if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server.</p>

<h2>DNS Spoofing</h2>

<p>Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. So clients need to be cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name association.</p>

<p>If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to achieve a performance improvement, they must observe the TTL information reported by the DNS. If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when a previously-accessed server's IP address changes.</p>

<h2>Location Headers and Spoofing</h2>

<p>If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust one another, then it MUST check the values of Location and Content Location headers in the responses that are generated under the control of said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to invalidate resources over which they have no authority.</p>

<h2>Authentication Credentials</h2>

<p>Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1 does not provide a method for a server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials which is a big security risk.</p>

<p>There are a number of work around to the parts of this problem, and so it is recommended to make the use of password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other methods that mitigate the security problems inherent in this problem.</p>

<h2>Proxies and Caching</h2>

<p>HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Proxies have access to security-related information, personal information about individual users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and content providers.</p>

<p>Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run, as they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive information.</p>

<p>Caching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation. Therefore, cache contents should be protected as sensitive information.</p>

<title>HTTP Quick Guide</title>

<h1>HTTP - Quick Guide</h1>

<p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (ie. internet) since 1990. HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extension of its request methods, error codes and headers.</p>

<p>Basically, HTTP is an TCP/IP based communication protocol, which is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results etc) on the World Wide Web. The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used. It provides a standardized way for  computers to communicate with each other. HTTP specification specifies how clients request data will be constructed and sent to the serve, and how servers respond to these requests.</p>

<h2>Basic Features</h2>

<p>There are  following three basic features which makes HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:</p>

<p><b>HTTP is connectionless:</b> The HTTP client ie. browser initiates an HTTP request  and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response. The server process the request and re-establish the connection with the client to send response back.</p>

<p><b>HTTP is media independent:</b> This means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and server know how to handle the data content. This is required for client as well as server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.</p>

<p><b>HTTP is stateless:</b> As mentioned above, HTTP is a connectionless and this is a direct result that HTTP is a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different request across the web pages.</p>

<h2>Basic Architecture</h2>

<p>Following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:</p>

<p>The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on client/server based architecture where web browser, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients and  Web server acts as server.</p>

<h3>Client</h3>

<p>The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity metainformation, and possible entity-body content.</p>

<h1>HTTP - Parameters</h1>

<p>This chapter is going to list down few of the important HTTP Protocol Parameters and their syntax in a way they are used in the communication. For example, format for date, format of URL etc. This will help you in constructing your request and response messages while writing HTTP client or server programs. You will see complete usage of these parameters in subsequent chapters while explaining message structure for HTTP requests and responses.</p>

<h2>HTTP Version</h2>

<p>HTTP uses a <b>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</b> numbering scheme to indicate versions of the protocol. The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in the first line. Here is the general syntax of specifying HTTP version number:</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)</h2>

<p>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) is simply formatted, case-insensitive string containing name, location etc to identify a resource, for example a website, a web service etc. A general syntax of URI used for HTTP is as follows:</p>

<p>Here if the <b>port</b> is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed for HTTP and an empty <b>abs_path</b> is equivalent to an <b>abs_path</b> of "/". The characters other than those in the <b>reserved</b> and <b>unsafe</b> sets are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following two URIs are equivalent:</p>

<h2>Date/Time Formats</h2>

<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>

<h2>Character Sets</h2>

<p>You use character set to specify the character sets that the client prefers. Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas. If a value is not specified, the default is US-ASCII.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following are valid character sets:</p>

<h2>Content Encodings</h2>

<p>A content ecoding values indicate an encoding algorithm has been used to encode the content before passing it over the network.  Content codings are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity.</p>

<p>All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding  header fields which we will see in subsequent chapters.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Following are valid encoding schemes:</p>

<h2>Media Types</h2>

<p>HTTP uses Internet Media Types in the <b>Content-Type</b> and <b>Accept</b> header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation. All the Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority ((IANA). Following is a general syntax to specify media type:</p>

<p>The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case- insensitive.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<h2>Language Tags</h2>

<p>HTTP uses language tags within the <b>Accept-Language</b> and <b>Content-Language</b> fields. A language tag is composed of 1 or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:</p>

<p>White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case- insensitive.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Example tags include:</p>

<p>Where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code.</p>

<h1>HTTP - Messages</h1>

<p>HTTP is  based on client-server architecture model and a stateless request/response protocol that operates by exchanging messages across a reliable TCP/IP connection.</p>

<p>An HTTP "client" is a program (Web browser or any other client) that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of sending one or more HTTP request messages.  An HTTP "server" is a program ( generally a web server like Apache Web Server or Internet Information Services IIS etc. ) that accepts connections in order to serve HTTP requests by sending HTTP response messages.</p>

<p>HTTP request and HTTP response use a generic message format of RFC 822 for transferring the required data. This generic message format consists of following four items.</p>

<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>

<h2>Message Start-Line</h2>

<p>A start-line will have following generic syntax:</p>

<p>We will discuss Request-Line and Status-Line while discussing HTTP Request and HTTP Response messages respectively. For now let's see the examples of start line in case of request and response:</p>

<h2>Header Fields</h2>

<p>HTTP deader fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are following four types of HTTP message headers:</p>

<p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p>

<p><b>Request-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for request messages.</p>

<p><b>Response-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for response messages.</p>

<p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present</p>

<p>All the above mentioned headers follow the same generic format and each  of the header field consists of a name followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and the field value as follows:</p>

<p>Following are the examples of various header fields:</p>

<h2>Message Body</h2>

<p>The message body part is optional for an HTTP message but if it is available then it is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response. If entity body is associated then usually <b>Content-Type</b> and <b> Content-Length</b> headers lines specify the nature of the body associated.</p>

<p>A message body is the one which carries actual HTTP request data (including form data and uploaded etc.) and HTTP response data from the server ( including files, images etc). Following is a simple content of a message body:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Requests</h1>

<p>An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:</p>

<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>

<h2>Message Request-Line</h2>

<p>The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>

<p>Let's discuss each of the part mentioned in Request-Line.</p>

<h2>Request Method</h2>

<p>The request <b>Method</b> indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given <b>Request-URI</b>. The method is case-sensitive ans should always be mentioned uppercase. Following are supported methods in HTTP/1.1</p>

<h2>Request-URI</h2>

<p>The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI:</p>

<p><b>OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1</b></p>

<p><b>GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p>

<p>Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root)</p>

<h2>Request Header Fields</h2>

<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now let's check what are Request header fields.</p>

<p>The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers and there are following important Request-header fields available which can be used based on requirement.</p>

<p>Accept-Charset</p>

<p> Accept-Encoding</p>

<p> Accept-Language</p>

<p> Authorization</p>

<p> Expect</p>

<p> From</p>

<p> Host</p>

<p> If-Match</p>

<p> If-Modified-Since</p>

<p> If-None-Match</p>

<p> If-Range</p>

<p> If-Unmodified-Since</p>

<p> Max-Forwards</p>

<p> Proxy-Authorization</p>

<p> Range</p>

<p> Referer</p>

<p> TE </p>

<p> User-Agent</p>

<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Client and Web Server.</p>

<h2>Request Message Examples</h2>

<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>

<p>Here we are not sending any request data to the server because we are fetching a plan HTML page from the server. Connection is a general-header used here and rest of the headers are request headers. Following is one more example where we send form data to the server using request message body:</p>

<p>Here given URL <i>/cgi-bin/process.cgi</i> will be used to process the passed data and accordingly a response will be retuned. Here <b>content-type</b> tells the server that passed data is simple web form data and <b>length</b> will be actual length of the data put in the message body. Following example shows how you can pass plan XML to your web server:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Responses</h1>

<p>After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:</p>

<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>

<h2>Message Status-Line</h2>

<p>The Status-Line consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>

<p>Let's discuss each of the part mentioned in Status-Line.</p>

<h2>HTTP Version</h2>

<p>A server supporting HTTP version 1.1 will return following version information:</p>

<h2>Status Code</h2>

<p>The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:</p>

<p>HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes. A list of all the status code has been given in a separate chapter for you reference.</p>

<h2>Response Header Fields</h2>

<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now let's check what are Response header fields.</p>

<p>The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.</p>

<p>Accept-Ranges</p>

<p>Age</p>

<p>ETag</p>

<p>Location</p>

<p>Proxy-Authenticate</p>

<p>Retry-After</p>

<p>Server</p>

<p>Vary</p>

<p>WWW-Authenticate</p>

<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Web Client and Server.</p>

<h2>Response Message Examples</h2>

<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP response for a request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>

<p>Following is an example of HTTP response message showing error condition when web server could not find requested page:</p>

<p>Following is an example of HTTP response message showing error condition when web server encountered a wrong HTTP version in given HTTP request:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Methods</h1>

<p>The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below and this set can be expanded based on requirement. These method names are case sensitive and they must be used in uppercase.</p>

<h2>GET Method</h2>

<p>A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. Following is a simple example which makes use of GET method to fetch hello.htm:</p>

<p>Following will be a server response against the above GET request:</p>

<h2>HEAD Method</h2>

<p>The HEAD method is functionally like GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body. Following is a simple example which makes use of HEAD method to fetch header information about hello.htm:</p>

<p>Following will be a server response against the above GET request:</p>

<p>You can notice that here server does not send any data after header.</p>

<h2>POST Method</h2>

<p>The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example file update, form data etc. Following is a simple example which makes use of POST method to send  a form data to the server which will be processed by a process.cgi and finally a response will be returned:</p>

<p>Server side script process.cgi process the passed data and send following response:</p>

<h2>PUT Method</h2>

<p>The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. The following example request server to save the given entity-boy in <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>

<p>The server will store given entity-body in <b>hello.htm</b> file and will send  following response back to the client:</p>

<h2>DELETE Method</h2>

<p>The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete file at a location specified by the given URL. The following example request server to delete the given file <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>

<p>The server will delete mentioned file <b>hello.htm</b> and will send  following response back to the client:</p>

<h2>CONNECT Method</h2>

<p>The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP. The following example request a connection with a web server running on host tutorialspoint.com:</p>

<p>The connection is established with the server and following response is sent back to the client:</p>

<h2>OPTIONS Method</h2>

<p>The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out what are the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify  a URL for the OPTIONS method,  or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. The following example request a list of methods supported by a web server running on tutorialspoint.com:</p>

<p>The server will send information based on the current configuration of the server, for example:</p>

<h2>TRACE Method</h2>

<p>The TRACE method is used to eacho the contents of an HTTP Request back to the requester which can be used for debugging purpose at the time of development. The following example shows the usage of TRACE method:</p>

<p>The server will send following message in response of the above request:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Status Codes</h1>

<p>The Status-Code element in a server response, is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:</p>

<p>HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes. Following is a list of all the status code.</p>

<h2>1xx: Information</h2>

<h2>2xx: Successful</h2>

<h2>3xx: Redirection</h2>

<h2>4xx: Client Error</h2>

<h2>5xx: Server Error</h2>

<h1>HTTP - Header Fields</h1>

<p>HTTP deader fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are following four types of HTTP message headers:</p>

<p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p>

<p><b>Client Request-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for request messages.</p>

<p><b>Server Response-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for response messages.</p>

<p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present</p>

<h2>General Headers</h2>

<h3>Cache-control</h3>

<p>The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching system. Following is the syntax:</p>

<p>An HTTP clients or servers can use the <b>Cache-control</b> general header to specify parameters for the cache or to request certain kinds of documents from the cache. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>

<p>There are following important cache request directives which can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>

<p>There are following important cache response directives which can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>

<h3>Connection</h3>

<p>The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections. Following is the simple syntax of using connection header:</p>

<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the "closed" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example:</p>

<p>By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the  connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default. If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the <b>keep-alive</b> parameter as follows:</p>

<h3>Date</h3>

<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>

<p>Here first format is the most preferred one.</p>

<h3>Pragma</h3>

<p>The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation- specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. For example:</p>

<p>The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility. No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.</p>

<h3>Trailer</h3>

<p>The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding. Following is the syntax of Trailer header field:</p>

<p>Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:</p>

<p>Transfer-Encoding</p>

<p>Content-Length</p>

<p>Trailer</p>

<h3>Transfer-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Transfer-Encoding</i> general-header field indicates what type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body.  Following is the syntax of Transfer-Encoding header field:</p>

<p>All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.</p>

<h3>Upgrade</h3>

<p>The <i>Upgrade</i> general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. For example:</p>

<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol</p>

<h3>Via</h3>

<p>The <i>Via</i> general-header must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients.  For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu. The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:</p>

<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>The <i>Warning</i> general-header is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. A response may carry more than one Warning header.</p>

<h2>Client Request Headers</h2>

<h3>Accept</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept</i> request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<p>This would be interpreted as <b>text/html</b> and <b>text/x-c</b> are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the <b>text/x-dvi</b> entity, and if that does not exist, send the <b>text/plain</b> entity.</p>

<h3>Accept-Charset</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Charset</i> request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<p>The special value "*", if present in the <b>Accept-Charset</b> field, matches every character set and if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Accept-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Encoding</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following are examples:</p>

<h3>Accept-Language</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Language</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Authorization</h3>

<p>The <i>Authorization</i> request-header field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of <b>username:password</b> encoded in base 64. Following is an example:</p>

<p>The value decodes into is <b>guest:guest123</b> where <b>guest</b> is user ID and <b>guest123</b> is the password.</p>

<h3>Cookie</h3>

<p>The <i>Cookie</i> request-header  field value contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:</p>

<h3>Expect</h3>

<p>The <i>Expect</i> request-header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are required by the client. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support, it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.</p>

<h3>From</h3>

<p>The <i>From</i> request-header field contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.</p>

<h3>Host</h3>

<p>The <i>Host</i> request-header field is used to specify the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>A <b>host</b> without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80. For example, a request on the origin server for <i>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/</i> would be:</p>

<h3>If-Match</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header request the server to perform the requested method only if given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists. Following are possible examples:</p>

<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-Modified-Since</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Modified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested URL has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>An example of the field is:</p>

<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-None-Match</h3>

<p>The <i>If-None-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header request the server to perform the requested method only if one of the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist. Following are possible examples:</p>

<h3>If-Range</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Range</i> request-header field can be used with a conditional GET to request only the portion of the entity that is missing, if it has not been changed, and the entire entity if it has changed. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received.  For example:</p>

<p>Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header otherwise, it returns all of the new document.</p>

<h3>If-Unmodified-Since</h3>

<p>The <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present. For example:</p>

<p>If the request normally would result in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> header should be ignored.</p>

<h3>Max-Forwards</h3>

<p>The <i>Max-Forwards</i> request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining number of times this request message may be forwarded. This is useful for debugging with the TRACE method, avoiding infinite loops.  For example:</p>

<p>The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in HTTP specification.</p>

<h3>Proxy-Authorization</h3>

<p>The <i>Proxy-Authorization</i> request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.</p>

<h3>Range</h3>

<p>The <i>Range</i> request-header field specifies the partial range(s) of the content requested from the document. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions specified are inclusive. You can specify a byte-unit as bytes Byte offsets start at zero.  Following are a simple examples:</p>

<p>Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas. If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document. If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.</p>

<h3>Referer</h3>

<p>The <i>Referer</i> request-header field allows the client to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the URL has been requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the <i>Request-URI</i>.</p>

<h3>TE</h3>

<p>The <i>TE</i> request-header field indicates what extension <i>transfer-coding</i> it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked <i>transfer-coding</i>. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways:</p>

<p>If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, the only transfer-coding is <i>chunked</i>. A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.</p>

<h3>User-Agent</h3>

<p>The <i>User-Agent</i> request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<h2>Server Response Headers</h2>

<h3>Accept-Ranges</h3>

<p>The <i>Accept-Ranges</i> response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>For example a  server that accept byte-range requests may send</p>

<p> Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:</p>

<p>This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.</p>

<h3>Age</h3>

<p>The <i>Age</i> response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p> Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache must include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache.</p>

<h3>ETag</h3>

<p>The <i>ETag</i> response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following are simple examples:</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The <i>Location</i> response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.</p>

<h3>Proxy-Authenticate</h3>

<p>The <i>Proxy-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included as part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<h3>Retry-After</h3>

<p>The <i>Retry-After</i> response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following are two simple examples:</p>

<p>In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.</p>

<h3>Server</h3>

<p>The <i>Server</i> response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.</p>

<h3>Set-Cookie</h3>

<p>The <i>Set-Cookie</i> response-header field contains a name/value pair of information to retain for this URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie:, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Here are possible values you can specify as options:</p>

<p>Following is an example of a simple cookie header generated by the server:</p>

<h3>Vary</h3>

<p>The <i>Vary</i> response-header field specifies that the entity has multiple sources and may therefore vary according to specified list of request header(s). Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>You can specify multiple headers separated by commas and a value of asterisk "*" signals that unspecified parameters not limited to the request-headers. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>Here field names are case-insensitive.</p>

<h3>WWW-Authenticate</h3>

<p>The <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>WWW- Authenticate field value as it might contain more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters. Following is a simple example:</p>

<h2>Entity Headers</h2>

<h3>Allow</h3>

<p>The <i>Allow</i> entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>You can specify multiple method separated by commas. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.</p>

<h3>Content-Encoding</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Encoding</i> entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).</p>

<h3>Content-Language</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Language</i> entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.</p>

<h3>Content-Length</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Length</i> entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.</p>

<h3>Content-Location</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Location</i> entity-header field may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity. </p>

<h3>Content-MD5</h3>

<p>Following is a simple example:</p>

<p>The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.</p>

<h3>Content-Range</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Range</i> entity-header field  is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:</p>

<p>When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range,  this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,</p>

<h3>Content-Type</h3>

<p>The <i>Content-Type</i> entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Expires</h3>

<p>The <i>Expires</i> entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<h3>Last-Modified</h3>

<p>The <i>Last-Modified</i> entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified. Following is the general syntax:</p>

<p>Following is an example:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Caching</h1>

<p>HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where performance can be improved by the use of response caches. The HTTP/1.1 protocol includes a number of elements intended to make caching work.</p>

<p>The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need to send requests in many cases, and to eliminate the need to send full responses in many other cases. </p>

<p>The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 are implicit directives to caches where server-specifies expiration times and validators. We use the <b>Cache-Control</b> header for this purpose.</p>

<p>The <b>Cache-Control</b> header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>

<p>There are following important cache request directives which can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>

<p>There are following important cache response directives which can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>

<h1>HTTP - URL Encoding</h1>

<p>HTTP URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII <i>character-set</i>, which often contain characters outside the ASCII set. So these unsafe characters must be replaced with a <b>%</b> followed by two hexadecimal digits.</p>

<p>Following table shows ASCII symbol of the character and its equal Symbol and finally its replacement which can be used in URL before passing it to the server:</p>

<h1>HTTP - Security</h1>

<p>HTTP is used for a communication over the internet, so application developers, information providers, and users should be aware of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1. This discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems mentioned here but it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.</p>

<h2>Personal Information leakage</h2>

<p>HTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information  such as the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption keys, etc. So you should be very careful to prevent unintentional leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.</p>

<p>All the confidential information should be stored at server side in encrypted form.</p>

<p>Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is known to contain security holes.</p>

<p>Proxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall should take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information that identifies the hosts behind the firewall.</p>

<p>The information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it should not be transmitted without the user being able to disable, enable, and modify the contents of the field.</p>

<p>Clients should not include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol.</p>

<p>Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol should not use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI</p>

<h2>File and path names based attack</h2>

<p>The document should be restricted to the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the server administrators.</p>

<p>For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use <b>..</b> as a path component to indicate a directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server MUST disallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server.</p>

<h2>DNS Spoofing</h2>

<p>Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. So clients need to be cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name association.</p>

<p>If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to achieve a performance improvement, they must observe the TTL information reported by DNS. If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when a previously-accessed server's IP address changes.</p>

<h2>Location Headers and Spoofing</h2>

<p>If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust one another, then it MUST check the values of Location and Content- Location headers in responses that are generated under control of said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to invalidate resources over which they have no authority.</p>

<h2>Authentication Credentials</h2>

<p>Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1. does not provide a method for a server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials which is a big security risk.</p>

<p>There are a number of work- arounds to parts of this problem, and so its is recommended to make the use of password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other methods which mitigate the security problems inherent in this problem.</p>

<h2>Proxies and Caching</h2>

<p>HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Proxies have access to security-related information, personal information about individual users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and content providers.</p>

<p>Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run as they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive information.</p>

<p>Caching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation. Therefore, cache contents should be protected as sensitive information.</p>

<h1>HTTP - Message Examples</h1>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on <i>tutorialspoint.com</i></p>

<h3>Client request</h3>

<h3>Server response</h3>

<h2>Example 2</h2>

<p>HTTP request to fetch <b>t.html</b> page which does not exist on the web server running on <i>tutorialspoint.com</i></p>

<h3>Client request</h3>

<h3>Server response</h3>

<h2>Example 3</h2>

<p>HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page  from the web server running on <i>tutorialspoint.com</i>, but request goes with wrong HTTP version:</p>

<h3>Client request</h3>

<h3>Server response</h3>

<h2>Example 4</h2>

<p>HTTP request to post form data to <b>process.cgi</b> CGI page  on a web server running on <i>tutorialspoint.com</i>. Server returns passed name after setting them as cookies:</p>

<h3>Client request</h3>

<h3>Server response</h3>

<p>&copy; Copyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.0

or

HTTP/1.1
</pre>
<h2>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)</h2>
<p>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) is simply formatted, case-insensitive string containing name, location etc to identify a resource, for example a website, a web service etc. A general syntax of URI used for HTTP is as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
URI = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
</pre>
<p>Here if the <b>port</b> is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed for HTTP and an empty <b>abs_path</b> is equivalent to an <b>abs_path</b> of "/". The characters other than those in the <b>reserved</b> and <b>unsafe</b> sets are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following two URIs are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html
http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html
http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html
</pre>
<h2>Date/Time Formats</h2>
<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</pre>

<h2>Character Sets</h2>
<p>You use character set to specify the character sets that the client prefers. Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas. If a value is not specified, the default is US-ASCII.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following are valid character sets:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
US-ASCII

or

ISO-8859-1

or 

ISO-8859-7
</pre>
<h2>Content Encodings</h2>
<p>A content ecoding values indicate an encoding algorithm has been used to encode the content before passing it over the network.  Content codings are primarily used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully transformed without losing the identity.</p>
<p>All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding  header fields which we will see in subsequent chapters.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Following are valid encoding schemes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-encoding: gzip

or

Accept-encoding: compress

or 

Accept-encoding: deflate
</pre>
<h2>Media Types</h2>
<p>HTTP uses Internet Media Types in the <b>Content-Type</b> and <b>Accept</b> header fields in order to provide open and extensible data typing and type negotiation. All the Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number Authority ((IANA). Following is a general syntax to specify media type:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
media-type     = type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )
</pre>
<p>The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case- insensitive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept: image/gif
</pre>
<h2>Language Tags</h2>
<p>HTTP uses language tags within the <b>Accept-Language</b> and <b>Content-Language</b> fields. A language tag is composed of 1 or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of subtags:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
language-tag  = primary-tag *( "-" subtag )
</pre>
<p>White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case- insensitive.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Example tags include:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
 en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin
</pre>
<p>Where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code.</p>
<h1>HTTP - Messages</h1>
<p>HTTP is  based on client-server architecture model and a stateless request/response protocol that operates by exchanging messages across a reliable TCP/IP connection.</p>
<p>An HTTP "client" is a program (Web browser or any other client) that establishes a connection to a server for the purpose of sending one or more HTTP request messages.  An HTTP "server" is a program ( generally a web server like Apache Web Server or Internet Information Services IIS etc. ) that accepts connections in order to serve HTTP requests by sending HTTP response messages.</p>
<p>HTTP makes use of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify a given resource and to establish a connection. Once connection is established, <b>HTTP messages</b> are passed in a format
similar to that used by Internet mail [RFC5322] and the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [RFC2045]. These messages are consisted of <b>requests</b> from client to server and <b>responses</b> from server to client which will have following format:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
 HTTP-message   = &lt;Request&gt; | &lt;Response&gt; ; HTTP/1.1 messages
</pre>
<p>HTTP request and HTTP response use a generic message format of RFC 822 for transferring the required data. This generic message format consists of following four items.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
<ul class="list">
<li>A Start-line</li>
<li>Zero or more header fields followed by CRLF</li>
<li>An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields</li>
<li>Optionally a message-body</li>
</pre>
<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>
<h2>Message Start-Line</h2>
<p>A start-line will have following generic syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
start-line = Request-Line | Status-Line
</pre>
<p>We will discuss Request-Line and Status-Line while discussing HTTP Request and HTTP Response messages respectively. For now let's see the examples of start line in case of request and response:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1     (This is Request-Line sent by the client)

HTTP/1.1 200 OK             (This is Status-Line sent by the server)
</pre>
<h2>Header Fields</h2>
<p>HTTP deader fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are following four types of HTTP message headers:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Request-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for request messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Response-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All the above mentioned headers follow the same generic format and each  of the header field consists of a name followed by a colon (<b>:</b>) and the field value as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
message-header = field-name ":" [ field-value ]
</pre>
<p>Following are the examples of various header fields:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en, mi
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 51
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/plain
</pre>
<h2>Message Body</h2>
<p>The message body part is optional for an HTTP message but if it is available then it is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response. If entity body is associated then usually <b>Content-Type</b> and <b> Content-Length</b> headers lines specify the nature of the body associated.</p>
<p>A message body is the one which carries actual HTTP request data (including form data and uploaded etc.) and HTTP response data from the server ( including files, images etc). Following is a simple content of a message body:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h1>HTTP - Requests</h1>
<p>An HTTP client sends an HTTP request to a server in the form of a request message which includes following format:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
<ul class="list">
<li>A Request-line</li>
<li>Zero or more header (General|Request|Entity) fields followed by CRLF</li>
<li>An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields</li>
<li>Optionally a message-body</li>
</pre>
<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>
<h2>Message Request-Line</h2>
<p>The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF
</pre>
<p>Let's discuss each of the part mentioned in Request-Line.</p>
<h2>Request Method</h2>
<p>The request <b>Method</b> indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given <b>Request-URI</b>. The method is case-sensitive ans should always be mentioned uppercase. Following are supported methods in HTTP/1.1</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Method and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>GET</b><br>The GET method is used to retrieve  information from the given server using a given URI.  Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>HEAD</b><br>Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>POST</b><br>A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example customer information, file upload etc using HTML forms.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>PUT</b><br>Replace all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>DELETE</b><br>Remove all current representations of the target resource given by URI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>CONNECT</b><br>Establish a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><b>OPTIONS</b><br>Describe the communication options for the target resource.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><b>TRACE</b><br>Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Request-URI</h2>
<p>The Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request. Following are the most commonly used forms to specify an URI:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Request-URI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority
</pre>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Method and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>The asterisk <b>*</b> is used when HTTP request does not apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. For example:<br>
<p><b>OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1</b></p></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>The <b>absoluteURI</b> is used when HTTP request is being made to a proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it from a valid cache, and return the response. For example:<br>
<p><b>GET http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1</b></p></td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>The most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a resource on an origin server or gateway. For example, a client wishing to retrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host "www.w3.org" and send the lines:<br>
<p><b>GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1<br>
Host: www.w3.org</b></p>
<p>Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as "/" (the server root)</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>Request Header Fields</h2>
<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now let's check what are Request header fields.</p>
<p>The request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers and there are following important Request-header fields available which can be used based on requirement.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Accept-Charset</p></li>  
<li><p> Accept-Encoding</p></li>  
<li><p> Accept-Language</p></li>  
<li><p> Authorization</p></li>  
<li><p> Expect</p></li>  
<li><p> From</p></li>  
<li><p> Host</p></li>  
<li><p> If-Match</p></li>  
<li><p> If-Modified-Since</p></li>  
<li><p> If-None-Match</p></li>  
<li><p> If-Range</p></li>  
<li><p> If-Unmodified-Since</p></li>  
<li><p> Max-Forwards</p></li>  
<li><p> Proxy-Authorization</p></li>  
<li><p> Range</p></li>  
<li><p> Referer</p></li>  
<li><p> TE </p></li>

<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Client and Web Server.</p>
<h2>Request Message Examples</h2>
<p>Now let's put it all together to form an HTTP request to fetch <b>hello.htm</b> page from the web server running on tutorialspoint.com</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
<p>Here we are not sending any request data to the server because we are fetching a plan HTML page from the server. Connection is a general-header used here and rest of the headers are request headers. Following is one more example where we send form data to the server using request message body:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: <b>length</b>
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

licenseID=string&content=string&/paramsXML=string
</pre>
<p>Here given URL <i>/cgi-bin/process.cgi</i> will be used to process the passed data and accordingly a response will be retuned. Here <b>content-type</b> tells the server that passed data is simple web form data and <b>length</b> will be actual length of the data put in the message body. Following example shows how you can pass plan XML to your web server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: <b>length</b>
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;string xmlns="http://clearforest.com/"&gt;string&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>
<h1>HTTP - Responses</h1>
<p>After receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
<ul class="list">
<li>A Status-line</li>
<li>Zero or more header (General|Response|Entity) fields followed by CRLF</li>
<li>An empty line (i.e., a line with nothing preceding the CRLF) indicating the end of the header fields</li>
<li>Optionally a message-body</li>
</pre>
<p>Following section will explain each of the entities used in HTTP message.</p>
<h2>Message Status-Line</h2>
<p>The Status-Line consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase. The elements are separated by space SP characters.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Status-Line = HTTP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
</pre>
<p>Let's discuss each of the part mentioned in Status-Line.</p>
<h2>HTTP Version</h2>
<p>A server supporting HTTP version 1.1 will return following version information:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP-Version = HTTP/1.1
</pre>
<h2>Status Code</h2>
<p>The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer where first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Code and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>1xx: Informational</b><br> This means request received and continuing process.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>2xx: Success</b><br> This means  the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>3xx: Redirection</b><br> This means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>4xx: Client Error</b><br> This means the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>5xx: Server Error</b><br> The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request</td></tr>
</table>
<p>HTTP status codes are extensible and HTTP applications are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes. A list of all the status code has been given in a separate chapter for you reference.</p>
<h2>Response Header Fields</h2>
<p>We will study General-header and Entity-header in a separate chapter when we will learn HTTP header fields. For now let's check what are Response header fields.</p>
<p>The response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status- Line. These header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Accept-Ranges</p></li>
<li><p>Age</p></li>
<li><p>ETag</p></li>
<li><p>Location</p></li>
<li><p>Proxy-Authenticate</p></li>
<li><p>Retry-After</p></li>
<li><p>Server</p></li>
<li><p>Vary</p></li>
<li><p>WWW-Authenticate</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can introduce your custom fields in case you are going to write your own custom Web Client and Server.</p>

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h1>HTTP - Methods</h1>
<p>The set of common methods for HTTP/1.1 is defined below and this set can be expanded based on requirement. These method names are case sensitive and they must be used in uppercase.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Method and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>GET</b><br>The GET method is used to retrieve  information from the given server using a given URI.  Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>HEAD</b><br>Same as GET, but only transfer the status line and header section.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>POST</b><br>A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example customer information, file upload etc using HTML forms.</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td><b>OPTIONS</b><br>Describe the communication options for the target resource.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><b>TRACE</b><br>Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>GET Method</h2>
<p>A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. Following is a simple example which makes use of GET method to fetch hello.htm:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
GET /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
<p>Following will be a server response against the above GET request:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h2>HEAD Method</h2>
<p>The HEAD method is functionally like GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body. Following is a simple example which makes use of HEAD method to fetch header information about hello.htm:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HEAD /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
<p>Following will be a server response against the above GET request:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed
</pre>
<p>You can notice that here server does not send any data after header.</p>
<h2>POST Method</h2>
<p>The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example file update, form data etc. Following is a simple example which makes use of POST method to send  a form data to the server which will be processed by a process.cgi and finally a response will be returned:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
POST /cgi-bin/process.cgi HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 88
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: Keep-Alive

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;string xmlns="http://clearforest.com/"&gt;string&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>
<p>Server side script process.cgi process the passed data and send following response:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
ETag: "34aa387-d-1568eb00"
Vary: Authorization,Accept
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 88
Content-Type: text/html
Connection: Closed

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Request Processed Successfully&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h2>PUT Method</h2>
<p>The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL. The following example request server to save the given entity-boy in <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
PUT /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-type: text/html
Content-Length: 182

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<p>The server will store given entity-body in <b>hello.htm</b> file and will send  following response back to the client:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The file was created.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h2>DELETE Method</h2>
<p>The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete file at a location specified by the given URL. The following example request server to delete the given file <b>hello.htm</b> at the root of the server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
DELETE /hello.htm HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
<p>The server will delete mentioned file <b>hello.htm</b> and will send  following response back to the client:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 30
Connection: Closed

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;URL deleted.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h2>CONNECT Method</h2>
<p>The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP. The following example request a connection with a web server running on host tutorialspoint.com:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
CONNECT www.tutorialspoint.com HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
</pre>
<p>The connection is established with the server and following response is sent back to the client:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 Connection established
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
</pre>
<h2>OPTIONS Method</h2>
<p>The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out what are the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify  a URL for the OPTIONS method,  or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. The following example request a list of methods supported by a web server running on tutorialspoint.com:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
</pre>
<p>The server will send information based on the current configuration of the server, for example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
Allow: GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS,TRACE
Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory
</pre>
<h2>TRACE Method</h2>
<p>The TRACE method is used to eacho the contents of an HTTP Request back to the requester which can be used for debugging purpose at the time of development. The following example shows the usage of TRACE method:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
TRACE / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.tutorialspoint.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
</pre>
<p>The server will send following message in response of the above request:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 27 Jul 2009 12:28:53 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)

<h1>HTTP - Header Fields</h1>
<p>HTTP deader fields provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. There are following four types of HTTP message headers:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p><b>General-header:</b> These header fields have general applicability for both request and response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Client Request-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for request messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Server Response-header:</b> These header fields are  applicability only for response messages.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Entity-header:</b> These header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>General Headers</h2>
<h3>Cache-control</h3>
<p>The Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching system. Following is the syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Cache-Control : cache-request-directive|cache-response-directive
</pre>
<p>An HTTP clients or servers can use the <b>Cache-control</b> general header to specify parameters for the cache or to request certain kinds of documents from the cache. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Cache-control: no-cache
</pre>
<p>There are following important cache request directives which can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Cache Request Directive and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>no-cache</b><br>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>no-store</b><br>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>max-age = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>max-stale [ = seconds ]</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If
seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>min-fresh = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>no-transform</b><br>Do not convert the entity-body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><b>only-if-cached</b><br>Do not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are following important cache response directives which can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Cache Request Directive and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>public</b><br>Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>private</b><br>Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>no-cache</b><br>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>no-store</b><br>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>no-transform</b><br>Do not convert the entity-body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>must-revalidate</b><br>The cache must verify the status of stale documents before using it and expired one should not be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><b>proxy-revalidate</b><br>The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><b>max-age = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><b>s-maxage = seconds</b><br>The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Connection</h3>
<p>The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and must not be communicated by proxies over further connections. Following is the simple syntax of using connection header:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Connection : "Connection"
</pre>
<p>HTTP/1.1 defines the "closed" connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Connection: Closed
</pre>
<p>By default, HTTP 1.1 uses persistent connections, where the  connection does not automatically close after a transaction. HTTP 1.0, on the other hand, does not have persistent connections by default. If a 1.0 client wishes to use persistent connections, it uses the <b>keep-alive</b> parameter as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Connection: keep-alive
</pre>
<h3>Date</h3>
<p>All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), without exception. HTTP applications are allowed to use any of the following three representations of date/time stamps:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
</pre>
<p>Here first format is the most preferred one.</p>
<h3>Pragma</h3>
<p>The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation- specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Pragma: no-cache
</pre>
<p>The only directive defined in HTTP/1.0 is the no-cache directive and is maintained in HTTP 1.1 for backward compatibility. No new Pragma directives will be defined in the future.</p>
<h3>Trailer</h3>
<p>The Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding. Following is the syntax of Trailer header field:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Trailer : field-name
</pre>
<p>Message header fields listed in the Trailer header field must not include the following header fields:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>Transfer-Encoding</p></li>
<li><p>Content-Length</p></li>
<li><p>Trailer</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Transfer-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Transfer-Encoding</i> general-header field indicates what type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This is not the same as content-encoding because transfer-encodings are a property of the message, not of the entity-body.  Following is the syntax of Transfer-Encoding header field:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
</pre>
<p>All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive.</p>
<h3>Upgrade</h3>
<p>The <i>Upgrade</i> general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
</pre>
<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol</p>
<h3>Via</h3>
<p>The <i>Via</i> general-header must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients.  For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code-named "fred", which uses HTTP/1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu. The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)
</pre>
<p>The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>The <i>Warning</i> general-header is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. A response may carry more than one Warning header.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Warning : warn-code SP warn-agent SP warn-text SP warn-date
</pre>
<h2>Client Request Headers</h2>
<h3>Accept</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept</i> request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept: type/subtype [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple media types can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for accept types on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c
</pre>
<p>This would be interpreted as <b>text/html</b> and <b>text/x-c</b> are the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the <b>text/x-dvi</b> entity, and if that does not exist, send the <b>text/plain</b> entity.</p>

<h3>Accept-Charset</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Charset</i> request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Charset: character_set [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple character sets can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred character sets on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1; q=0.8
</pre>
<p>The special value "*", if present in the <b>Accept-Charset</b> field, matches every character set and if no <b>Accept-Charset</b> header is present, the default is that any character set is acceptable.</p>

<h3>Accept-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Encoding</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Encoding: encoding types
</pre>
<p>Following are examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
Accept-Encoding:
Accept-Encoding: *
Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
</pre>

<h3>Accept-Language</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Language</i> request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Language: language [q=qvalue]
</pre>
<p>Multiple languages can be listed separated by commas and  the optional qvalue represents an acceptable quality level for nonpreferred languages on a scale of 0 to 1. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7
</pre>

<h3>Authorization</h3>
<p>The <i>Authorization</i> request-header field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Authorization : credentials
</pre>
<p>The HTTP/1.0 specification defines the BASIC authorization scheme, where the authorization parameter is the string of <b>username:password</b> encoded in base 64. Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Authorization: BASIC Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3QxMjM=
</pre>
<p>The value decodes into is <b>guest:guest123</b> where <b>guest</b> is user ID and <b>guest123</b> is the password.</p>

<h3>Cookie</h3>
<p>The <i>Cookie</i> request-header  field value contains a name/value pair of information stored for that URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Cookie: name=value
</pre>
<p>Multiple cookies can be specified separated by semicolons as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Cookie: name1=value1;name2=value2;name3=value3
</pre>

<h3>Expect</h3>
<p>The <i>Expect</i> request-header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are required by the client. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Expect : 100-continue | expectation-extension
</pre>
<p>If a server receives a request containing an Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not support, it must respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.</p>

<h3>From</h3>
<p>The <i>From</i> request-header field contains an Internet e-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
From: webmaster@w3.org
</pre>
<p>This header field may be used for logging purposes and as a means for identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests.</p>

<h3>Host</h3>
<p>The <i>Host</i> request-header field is used to specify the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Host : "Host" ":" host [ ":" port ] ;
</pre>
<p>A <b>host</b> without any trailing port information implies the default port, which is 80. For example, a request on the origin server for <i>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/</i> would be:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
Host: www.w3.org
</pre>

<h3>If-Match</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header request the server to perform the requested method only if given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Match : entity-tag
</pre>
<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity exists. Following are possible examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Match: "xyzzy"
If-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-Match: *
</pre>
<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-Modified-Since</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Modified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested URL has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Modified-Since : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>An example of the field is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>If none of the entity tags match, or if "*" is given and no current entity exists, the server must not perform the requested method, and must return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response.</p>

<h3>If-None-Match</h3>
<p>The <i>If-None-Match</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. This header request the server to perform the requested method only if one of the given value in this tag matches the given entity tags represented by <b>ETag</b>. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-None-Match : entity-tag
</pre>
<p>An asterisk (*) matches any entity, and the transaction continues only if the entity does not exist. Following are possible examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-None-Match: "xyzzy"
If-None-Match: "xyzzy", "r2d2xxxx", "c3piozzzz"
If-None-Match: *
</pre>

<h3>If-Range</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Range</i> request-header field can be used with a conditional GET to request only the portion of the entity that is missing, if it has not been changed, and the entire entity if it has changed. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Range : entity-tag | HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Either an entity tag or a date can be used to identify the partial entity already received.  For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Range: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>Here if the document has not been modified since the given date, the server returns the byte range given by the Range header otherwise, it returns all of the new document.</p>

<h3>If-Unmodified-Since</h3>
<p>The <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Unmodified-Since : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server should perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
If-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
</pre>
<p>If the request normally would result in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, the <i>If-Unmodified-Since</i> header should be ignored.</p>

<h3>Max-Forwards</h3>
<p>The <i>Max-Forwards</i> request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Max-Forwards : n
</pre>
<p>The Max-Forwards value is a decimal integer indicating the remaining number of times this request message may be forwarded. This is useful for debugging with the TRACE method, avoiding infinite loops.  For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Max-Forwards : 5
</pre>
<p>The Max-Forwards header field may be ignored for all other methods defined in HTTP specification.</p>
<h3>Proxy-Authorization</h3>
<p>The <i>Proxy-Authorization</i> request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Proxy-Authorization : credentials
</pre>
<p>The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.</p>
<h3>Range</h3>
<p>The <i>Range</i> request-header field specifies the partial range(s) of the content requested from the document. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Range: bytes-unit=first-byte-pos "-" [last-byte-pos]
</pre>
<p>The first-byte-pos value in a byte-range-spec gives the byte-offset of the first byte in a range. The last-byte-pos value gives the byte-offset of the last byte in the range; that is, the byte positions specified are inclusive. You can specify a byte-unit as bytes Byte offsets start at zero.  Following are a simple examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
- The first 500 bytes 
Range: bytes=0-499

- The second 500 bytes
Range: bytes=500-999

- The final 500 bytes
Range: bytes=-500

- The first and last bytes only
Range: bytes=0-0,-1
</pre>
<p>Multiple ranges can be listed, separated by commas. If the first digit in the comma-separated byte range(s) is missing, the range is assumed to count from the end of the document. If the second digit is missing, the range is byte n to the end of the document.</p>
<h3>Referer</h3>
<p>The <i>Referer</i> request-header field allows the client to specify the address (URI) of the resource from which the URL has been requested. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Referer : absoluteURI | relativeURI
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="result">
Referer: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>If the field value is a relative URI, it should be interpreted relative to the <i>Request-URI</i>.</p>
<h3>TE</h3>
<p>The <i>TE</i> request-header field indicates what extension <i>transfer-coding</i> it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked <i>transfer-coding</i>. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
TE   : t-codings
</pre>
<p>The presence of the keyword "trailers" indicates that the client is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding and it is specified either of the ways:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
TE: deflate
TE:
TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5
</pre>
<p>If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, the only transfer-coding is <i>chunked</i>. A message with no transfer-coding is always acceptable.</p>
<h3>User-Agent</h3>
<p>The <i>User-Agent</i> request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
User-Agent : product | comment
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE5.01; Windows NT)
</pre>
<h2>Server Response Headers</h2>
<h3>Accept-Ranges</h3>
<p>The <i>Accept-Ranges</i> response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Ranges  : range-unit | none
</pre>
<p>For example a  server that accept byte-range requests may send</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Ranges: bytes
</pre>
<p> Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource may send:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Accept-Ranges: none
</pre>
<p>This will advise the client not to attempt a range request.</p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>The <i>Age</i> response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Age : delta-seconds
</pre>
<p> Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Age: 1030
</pre>
<p>An HTTP/1.1 server that includes a cache must include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache.</p>
<h3>ETag</h3>
<p>The <i>ETag</i> response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
ETag :  entity-tag
</pre>
<p>Following are simple examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
ETag: "xyzzy"
ETag: W/"xyzzy"
ETag: ""
</pre>
<h3>Location</h3>
<p>The <i>Location</i> response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Location : absoluteURI
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>The Content-Location header field differs from Location in that the Content-Location identifies the original location of the entity enclosed in the request.</p>
<h3>Proxy-Authenticate</h3>
<p>The <i>Proxy-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included as part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Proxy-Authenticate  : challenge
</pre>

<h3>Retry-After</h3>
<p>The <i>Retry-After</i> response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Retry-After : HTTP-date | delta-seconds
</pre>
<p>Following are two simple examples:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT
Retry-After: 120
</pre>
<p>In the latter example, the delay is 2 minutes.</p>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>The <i>Server</i> response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Server : product | comment
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Server: Apache/2.2.14 (Win32)
</pre>
<p>If the response is being forwarded through a proxy, the proxy application must not modify the Server response-header.</p>
<h3>Set-Cookie</h3>
<p>The <i>Set-Cookie</i> response-header field contains a name/value pair of information to retain for this URL. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Set-Cookie: NAME=VALUE; OPTIONS
</pre>
<p>Set-Cookie response header comprises the token Set-Cookie:, followed by a comma-separated list of one or more cookies. Here are possible values you can specify as options:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Options and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>Comment=comment</b><br>This option can be used to specify any comment associated with the cookie.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b> Domain=domain</b><br> The Domain attribute specifies the domain for which the cookie is valid.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>Expires=Date-time</b><br>The date the cookie will expire. If this is blank, the cookie will expire when the visitor quits the browser </td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b> Path=path</b><br>The Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs to which this cookie applies.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>Secure</b><br>This instructs the user agent to return the cookie only under a secure connection.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Following is an example of a simple cookie header generated by the server:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT
</pre>
<h3>Vary</h3>
<p>The <i>Vary</i> response-header field specifies that the entity has multiple sources and may therefore vary according to specified list of request header(s). Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Vary : field-name
</pre>
<p>You can specify multiple headers separated by commas and a value of asterisk "*" signals that unspecified parameters not limited to the request-headers. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Vary: Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding
</pre>
<p>Here field names are case-insensitive.</p>
<h3>WWW-Authenticate</h3>
<p>The <i>WWW-Authenticate</i> response-header field must be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
WWW-Authenticate : challenge
</pre>
<p>WWW- Authenticate field value as it might contain more than one challenge, or if more than one WWW-Authenticate header field is provided, the contents of a challenge itself can contain a comma-separated list of authentication parameters. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
WWW-Authenticate: BASIC realm="Admin"
</pre>
<h2>Entity Headers</h2>
<h3>Allow</h3>
<p>The <i>Allow</i> entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Allow : Method
</pre>
<p>You can specify multiple method separated by commas. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT
</pre>
<p>This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.</p>

<h3>Content-Encoding</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Encoding</i> entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Encoding : content-coding
</pre>
<p>The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by the Request-URI. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Encoding: gzip
</pre>
<p>If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not acceptable to the origin server, the server should respond with a status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).</p>
<h3>Content-Language</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Language</i> entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Language : language-tag
</pre>
<p>Multiple languages may be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Language: mi, en
</pre>
<p>The primary purpose of Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate entities according to the user's own preferred language.</p>
<h3>Content-Length</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Length</i> entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Length : DIGITS
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Length: 3495
</pre>
<p>Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.</p>
<h3>Content-Location</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Location</i> entity-header field may be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Location:  absoluteURI | relativeURI 
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Location: http://www.tutorialspoint.org/http/index.htm
</pre>
<p>The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the entity. </p>
<h3>Content-MD5</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-MD5</i> entity-header field may be used to supply an MD5 digest of the entity, for checking the integrity
of the message upon receipt. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-MD5  : md5-digest using base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864
</pre>
<p>Following is a simple example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-MD5  : 8c2d46911f3f5a326455f0ed7a8ed3b3
</pre>
<p>The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body, including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body.</p>
<h3>Content-Range</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Range</i> entity-header field  is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Range : bytes-unit SP first-byte-pos "-" last-byte-pos
</pre>
<p>Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity contains a total of 1234 bytes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
- The first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 0-499/1234

- The second 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-999/1234

- All except for the first 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 500-1233/1234

- The last 500 bytes:
Content-Range : bytes 734-1233/1234
</pre>
<p>When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range,  this content is transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
Content-Length: 26012
Content-Type: image/gif
</pre>

<h3>Content-Type</h3>
<p>The <i>Content-Type</i> entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Type : media-type
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-4
</pre>

<h3>Expires</h3>
<p>The <i>Expires</i> entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Expires : HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT
</pre>

<h3>Last-Modified</h3>
<p>The <i>Last-Modified</i> entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified. Following is the general syntax:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Last-Modified: HTTP-date
</pre>
<p>Following is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
</pre>
<h1>HTTP - Caching</h1>
<p>HTTP is typically used for distributed information systems, where performance can be improved by the use of response caches. The HTTP/1.1 protocol includes a number of elements intended to make caching work.</p>
<p>The goal of caching in HTTP/1.1 is to eliminate the need to send requests in many cases, and to eliminate the need to send full responses in many other cases. </p>
<p>The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 are implicit directives to caches where server-specifies expiration times and validators. We use the <b>Cache-Control</b> header for this purpose.</p>
<p>The <b>Cache-Control</b> header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. The caching directives are specified in a comma-separated list. For example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
Cache-control: no-cache
</pre>
<p>There are following important cache request directives which can be used by the client in its HTTP request:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Cache Request Directive and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>no-cache</b><br>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>no-store</b><br>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>max-age = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>max-stale [ = seconds ]</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time. If
seconds are given, it must not be expired by more than that time.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>min-fresh = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>no-transform</b><br>Do not convert the entity-body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><b>only-if-cached</b><br>Do not retrieve new data. The cache can send a document only if it is in the cache, and should not contact the origin-server to see if a newer copy exists.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>There are following important cache response directives which can be used by the server in its HTTP response:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>S.N.</th><th>Cache Request Directive and Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>public</b><br>Indicates that the response may be cached by any cache.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><b>private</b><br>Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and must not be cached by a shared cache. </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>no-cache</b><br>A cache must not use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server. </td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>no-store</b><br>The cache should not store anything about the client request or server response.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>no-transform</b><br>Do not convert the entity-body.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>must-revalidate</b><br>The cache must verify the status of stale documents before using it and expired one should not be used.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><b>proxy-revalidate</b><br>The proxy-revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must- revalidate directive, except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><b>max-age = seconds</b><br>Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><b>s-maxage = seconds</b><br>The maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.</td></tr>
</table>
<h1>HTTP - URL Encoding</h1>
<p>HTTP URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII <i>character-set</i>, which often contain characters outside the ASCII set. So these unsafe characters must be replaced with a <b>%</b> followed by two hexadecimal digits.</p>
<p>Following table shows ASCII symbol of the character and its equal Symbol and finally its replacement which can be used in URL before passing it to the server:</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th>ASCII</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Replacement</th></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; 32</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Encode with %xx where xx is the hexadecimal representation of the character.</td></tr>
<tr><td>32</td><td>space</td><td>+ or %20</td></tr>

<h1>HTTP - Security</h1>
<p>HTTP is used for a communication over the internet, so application developers, information providers, and users should be aware of the security limitations in HTTP/1.1. This discussion does not include definitive solutions to the problems mentioned here but it does make some suggestions for reducing security risks.</p>
<h2>Personal Information leakage</h2>
<p>HTTP clients are often privy to large amounts of personal information  such as the user's name, location, mail address, passwords, encryption keys, etc. So you should be very careful to prevent unintentional leakage of this information via the HTTP protocol to other sources.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><p>All the confidential information should be stored at server side in encrypted form.</p></li>
<li><p>Revealing the specific software version of the server might allow the server machine to become more vulnerable to attacks against software that is known to contain security holes.</p></li>
<li><p>Proxies which serve as a portal through a network firewall should take special precautions regarding the transfer of header information that identifies the hosts behind the firewall.</p></li>
<li><p>The information sent in the From field might conflict with the user's privacy interests or their site's security policy, and hence it should not be transmitted without the user being able to disable, enable, and modify the contents of the field.</p></li>
<li><p>Clients should not include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol.</p></li>
<li><p>Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol should not use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>File and path names based attack</h2>
<p>The document should be restricted to the documents returned by HTTP requests to be only those that were intended by the server administrators.</p>
<p>For example, UNIX, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems use <b>..</b> as a path component to indicate a directory level above the current one. On such a system, an HTTP server MUST disallow any such construct in the Request-URI if it would otherwise allow access to a resource outside those intended to be accessible via the HTTP server.</p>
<h2>DNS Spoofing</h2>
<p>Clients using HTTP rely heavily on the Domain Name Service, and are thus generally prone to security attacks based on the deliberate mis-association of IP addresses and DNS names. So clients need to be cautious in assuming the continuing validity of an IP number/DNS name association.</p>
<p>If HTTP clients cache the results of host name lookups in order to achieve a performance improvement, they must observe the TTL information reported by DNS. If HTTP clients do not observe this rule, they could be spoofed when a previously-accessed server's IP address changes.</p>
<h2>Location Headers and Spoofing</h2>
<p>If a single server supports multiple organizations that do not trust one another, then it MUST check the values of Location and Content- Location headers in responses that are generated under control of said organizations to make sure that they do not attempt to invalidate resources over which they have no authority.</p>
<h2>Authentication Credentials</h2>
<p>Existing HTTP clients and user agents typically retain authentication information indefinitely. HTTP/1.1. does not provide a method for a server to direct clients to discard these cached credentials which is a big security risk.</p>
<p>There are a number of work- arounds to parts of this problem, and so its is recommended to make the use of password protection in screen savers, idle time-outs, and other methods which mitigate the security problems inherent in this problem.</p>
<h2>Proxies and Caching</h2>
<p>HTTP proxies are men-in-the-middle, and represent an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks. Proxies have access to security-related information, personal information about individual users and organizations, and proprietary information belonging to users and content providers.</p>
<p>Proxy operators should protect the systems on which proxies run as they would protect any system that contains or transports sensitive information.</p>
<p>Caching proxies provide additional potential vulnerabilities, since the contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious exploitation. Therefore, cache contents should be protected as sensitive information.</p>
